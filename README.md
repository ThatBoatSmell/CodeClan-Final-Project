# CodeClan-Final-Project
This is where all the stuff for my final project lives <br>
This was my final project for the professional data analysis course at codeclan. <br>
I looked at Steam + Steamspy data to try and work out what factors could lead to a games success. br>

The repo contains the data i used for my analysis, the processes i went through to get my results, and the final presentation.<br>
