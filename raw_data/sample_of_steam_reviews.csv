307780,Mortal Kombat X,"I hate when people ♥♥♥♥♥ about a game that isn't even OUT yet. 'Oh, stream is STUPID... blah blah blah blah...' Really? It's going to be OUT... COMPLETELY... on the 14th(today), when it is SUPPOSED to be... now either stop ♥♥♥♥♥ing and play, or keep ♥♥♥♥♥ing and keep your winey ♥♥♥ off of MKX  The game is going to be LEGIT when it's done releasing.

4000,Garry's Mod,"Spent $3.00 on this crappy 'game' and its really just a bunch of kids trolling each other playing detective, hide and seek, or playing dollhouse/doctor.  The fact that its a sandbox is kinda cool, because you can probably build some really cool stuff, but to be honest I have a lot more fun playing games than just sitting around using the assets and pretending I'm a 1337 programmer.  Get this on sale, if you really want to screw around with the Valve assets and/or stuff modders have created...  I've had this in my library for so long now, and I've rarely ever opened it just because every time I open it I realize its kinda boring and overhyped.  I give this a big 'meh.'  2/5",-1,0

310950,Street Fighter V,"An underwhelming experience  Imagine this: youre in business, you work for a client, you produce an incomplete product, ask for the cash upfront, and then deliver an incomplete, broken product, with a vague request to promise updates to fix and add features sometime in the future - would you accept this?  Dissapointed in Capcom, they used to produce quality games, now just happy to sponge as much cash from it's customers. Remember who pays your wages Capcom.  A story mode that is wayy to short with around 3 fighters to fight against each fighter, an online component which is juddery and results in bad amination, the recent update which includes a shop - which only seems to add colours to each character. Oh, and dont expect a decent single player mode too - the nearest thing to this is the survival mode.  We are encouraged to buy a season pass - even though theres no appaarent benefit to do so. The latest update includes a pathetic shop, ability to play as Alex and a sightly improved online experience. I feel like I've wasted 40 pounds on a gloried tech demo and not a proper game. Full your finger out Capcom.",-1,0

384190,ABZÛ,"I have never once ever loved or even cared about any shark in all of my life... until this game. This review goes out to you, Sharky. Videogames is art, and this game is a symphony of master levels. If you don't like fish or get bored easy, this game is not for you, but if you have any scrap of humanity left in your walking carcass then this game will rip that out, mold it into something amazing, stick it back in you, and make you cry over a group of Sperm Whales leaving you behind to venture forth into the ends of the map only to return and turn your tears of anguish into genuine tears of joy. Then you will have to say goodbye to the whales, but meeting then will have been worth it because somehow that 2 minutes of swimming next to them made you feel like it made you a better person.   This game is comparatively short, but you won't care. Everthing has perfect pacing and is structured like movements through an actual symphony and it lasts about as long as one. You will cry, you will laugh, you will say 'Oh my god, it's so cute/beautiful' so many times you be unable to keep track if you wanted to in the first place.   Fish musical simulator 2016 gets a 10/10 by me.",1,0

201810,Wolfenstein: The New Order,"Awesome game. It's fun and makes me wish they would remake Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Wolfenstein (2009).   Pros: -Small Timeline Choice -Awesome Weapons -Not so chaotic that you can't tell what's going on... unlike other games *looks at store page of Serious Sam 3* -Can run on computers as early as 2009 (Will be pretty laggy, ESPECIALLY at the beginning, but playable and, audio may be out of sync during certain parts) -Cutscenes run perfectly all the time (even on 2009 PCs) and, unlike in game text, audio is completely in sync. -You can choose to be stealthy or a tank during gameplay.  Cons: -AI can be a bit stupid sometimes -Once again, very laggy at the start. -Takes up 40.7 GB of space and, if your computer is older, it can take 4 or more hours to download   9/10",1,0

48700,Mount & Blade: Warband,"This game doesn't have the best graphics. The interface is clunky at times. A lot of the moment-to-moment gameplay is kind of tedious. And the herding cattle quest is just the worst. That said, I have more hours in this game than anything else in my library. There is simply no other game that does what this game does: it puts you in a medieval world as nobody, and lets you write your own story. What's more, this is the only game that allows you to pretend you're playing Total War one moment, and a jousting sim the next.",1,0
286100,You Have to Win the Game,"This started like 'meh, free game to try, probably some crap'.  Then BOOM Retronostalgic ultimate facepunch. Great ascetic graphic, addictive gameplay style and, what can I say - it's awesome.   If you (just like me) love playing retro-styled platform games, this one is for you. Launch, give this game few minutes and you will be wondering 'how this is going to end'?",1,1
105600,Terraria,"Terraria is a fun and charming game that will entertain you for hours. It has +1000 items, a lot of bosses to fight, multiple biomes, mounts, NPCs... and they keep updating the game adding more and more of these things. It's really hard to get bored if you enjoy playing it.  Keep in mind that in this game you'll have to gather resources in order to progress. Some people are not interested in those kind of features where you are forced to spend some time doing the same thing over and over like going out to chop down some trees in order to get wood, it's totally understandable. Don't misunderstand me, you are not 24/7 gathering resources, but if you like to build or decorate, or you are looking for a rare drop of an enemy, you'll have to work. In Terraria you'll progress by gathering resources, defending yourself from the vast variety of enemies that roams the lands around you, killing bosses and exploring.  While exploring, you'll find chests with some precious items inside and NPCs that will help you out on your adventure. Those NPCs can live inside your house if you build them a room although some of them need some more requirements, it's a good idea to take a look at the Terraria Wiki to know every detail about the NPCs, some of them will only appear after meeting some requirements like for example killing a boss. Those NPCs will help you out selling precious and powerful items that will help you on your adventure, healing you or giving you some quests.  One of the things I like the most is the huge customization of the world and your character. You can build your house however you want, wherever you want. If you build a massive house, don't worry because it won't feel empty. One of the things that I dislike from other sandbox games is the scarce decoration of your home, in Terraria you can make everything you want. Sometimes you'll have to make it even bigger to put inside even more things because you run out of space!  The multiplayer aspect has improved a lot since you can play with your friends via Steam, it's as easy as joining they world, you don't have to use third party programs to be able to play together. :^)  To sum up, Terraria is a great game that will satisfy collectors and explorers, with its massive quantity of items, enemies and places to explore. I mean if you've read everything and you liked it all, for 9,99 it's an amazing price. It won't disappoint you and if it does, you can always refund it. ^_^   I hope my review's been useful and have fun!",1,0

230190,War for the Overworld,"Would not recomend it at all in its current state. Just keep in mind that this is a normal (as in 'done and ready for use') release. There is still at least one patch per day and lots of bugs. On my system I can't play it at all. It would have been acceptable as early access, but releasing the game in this state normaly is in my opinion lying to the customer.",-1,0
223100,Homefront: The Revolution,"Homefront has all the right ideas, a story, large open world, different mechanics it all seems good. However the execution of these ideas leads to one of the worst games ive play while having the ideas I love. Its story falls short on importance, its open world suffers from buggy gameplay with far to few weapons and equipment. The A.I are a joke, friends cant hit anything and enemies kill you with no real notification that you are being shot. It reall is a shame considering how cool the games ideas are. Taking back a city from occupying DRNK forces block by block. With all these issues the multiplayer also has some great ideas, of outfitting a soldier and upgrading their gear and equipment how you see fit. With a backstory that acts like a perk, i can understand the direction. Again its poor execution, long load times, limited amounts of missions, and barely anyone to play with. Good try Deepsilver good try.",-1,0

293440,Elliot Quest,"really wanted to like this game, but man is it poorly designed. I get that they wanted to do the overworld thing and tease future abilities by blocking progress, but they do it ALL THE DAMN TIME. Literally every stop on the map when you start the game with the exception of the village is a progress blocker, so you go in- turn around and leave. With no explanation.  There might be a really solid game behind the first 30 minutes- but I don't even care enough to find out anymore.",-1,0
241540,State of Decay,"Fun game that keeps you glued on to your seat for hours of gameplay. It can be a bit flimsy here and there, and it's not like The Walking Dead story but it does get you goin. It was worth it on sale.",1,0
220240,Far Cry® 3,"VALUE:  I'm a frugal gamer, and so value is one of my major concerns. I look games that provide a lot of content, but are offered at an affordable price. Far Cry 3 definitely delivers in volume of content, and being a 3 year old game, you can find it at a good price every once in a while. It gives you a large map to explore, with lots of secrets. Also, this game rewards explorers like me; the discovery of collectibles isn't only rewarded with achievements (which I don't care much about), but also with XP, which you can apply to a pretty cool skill tree that makes your character more resilient, mobile or deadly.  STORY:  The story is pretty stock: get revenge, rescue your pals-- and the theme is your typical 'white guy goes native and turns out to be the best of the best (see: Dances with Wolves, Tarzan, Avatar)' garbage but I really liked the voice acting, which is always competent, and sometimes excellent. The voice actors behind the characters Vaas and Dennis are the standouts.  PERFORMANCE:  I was a bit concerned that I wouldn't be able to play this on my PC, because I don't have a really powerful graphics card, but with my graphics settings at medium and rez At 1366x768, I get a frame rate that's definitely playable, and it still looks pretty.  CONTROL:  If you're a KbM player, don't be scared off by this console port. When it comes to first person games, I am a KbM player for the most part, but I decided to try playing Far Cry 3 with the controller, as was originally intended. There was definitely a learning curve with aiming with a stick, but it was quickly overcome. I still can't say that I'm really good at shooting with sticks, but it sure beats being hunched over a keyboard. Sometimes the contextual controls are a pain, because sometimes you have to wait for a prompt, but all in all, control is decent.  DRM  I've seen a lot of reviews complain about Uplay. Sure, setting it up was an inconvenience I could have done without, but it seems to be working well with the game, and it's playing nice with Steam. Just do what I did: install Uplay independently of Steam.  This is one that you don't want to pass up; particularly if it's on sale.",1,0

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"This game is perfect. The characters, the story, the gameplay, each element of the game is well thought-out and executed. The only downside is the monster hunts that are not a part of quests become very redundant and boring after a while. A little variation in these would have gone a long way; more variety in monsters would have made a huge difference. All in all this game is great. 9.5/10",1,0

Tl;dr:  A Story About My Uncle  is an excellent first person platformer with just enough fresh ideas to fill a 2 - 3 hour time period. Fortunately, it lasts exactly that long, and never outstays its welcome. It also has an interesting world and good, if not great, visuals and art design.     Full Review:",1,0

Though the animations seemed clunky and the seemingly pay to win structure discouraged me slightly, the game had nearly just released, and these things could have been changed.

451760,Highway Blossoms,"Highway Blossoms went above and beyond what I expected from a Visual Novel, I'm extremely glad I took the time to play this gem of a game.   Story wise, the game is rather short. But that's mostly because I read pretty fast, so I clocked in around 4 hours or so of reading instead of the stated 6 hours or so stated. Guess all that fanfiction reading skills got put to good use lmao.   One thing I liked about the writing in general was how trim it was. There's almost no filler throughout the entire story and I can appreciate a game that tells a simple, great story rather than just dragging on for no particular reason but to increase your playtime. The other thing I liked was the humor, which got quite alot of chuckles from me throughout. Also, I found the main couple Amber and Marina heart stoppingly cute, and their dialouge even more so.   Art-wise, the game is flawless. CG's and backgrounds are superb on my monitor and the words in the text box are easy to read and easy on the eyes. Character sprites (is that the right word?) do occasionally move and I love how sutble and effective it was in trying to make everything more lifelike. Masterful programming. There is no bugs, as far as I can tell, which makes it the icing on top of the cake.   The music is pleasant throughout as well. I never once thought the background music was grating. On the contrary I found it rather relaxing to listen to, so I'll definitely be getting the DLC soundtrack. Highway Blossoms also makes good use of its music as well as silence. There are stretches of story that have no music at all - which makes the seriousness of the current scene pack a heavier punch.   Overall, I think that Highway Blossoms is a quality VN. For it's length and quality of the content, the asking price is more than fair. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this if I was a yuri fan (viva la yuri) or a avid VN reader.   TL:DR - 9/10",1,0

332200,Axiom Verge,"This is the closest you will ever get to experiencing Super Metroid again. The story is intriguing enough without being intrusive. The game evolves constantly as you continue to discover new items and upgrades that change how you traverse the world and fight enemies.  Metroid vets will rejoice at constantly being surprised by the game's setting up your expectations and taking a hard left turn. Who needs a morph ball? Not I.  If you're a fan of side scrollers, dungeon crawlers or just plain exploration of an emerging and ever changing world this game will grip you for hours and hours.",1,1

EDIT: OCTOBER 15TH 2016 With the new safehouse and other such things, I strongly recommend payday.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"I haven't had so much fun since the early days of Quake 3 Arena. If you liked that back in the day then you must give this a try. This was actually a gift, and had gone completely under my radar, else I would have been enjoying some time ago.  It works well enough on my older Core2Duo E8400, 8GB RAM, ATI 6700, Windows 7, so really shouldn't stretch any modern hardware.  If you like 1st person online combat then this has something for everyone - free for all, team play, capture the flag, last man standing etc. 4 classes to choose from, each with their own learning curve and distinctive gameplay. It takes several hours play to really start to get the hang of each.  Be warned - this has had my staying up late into the night - always the temptation for 'just one more round' - so highly addictive.  The only downside is a few minor bugs. The most glaring problem is that I (and others) are unable to progress beyond rank 5, so some weapons remain forever locked until this is sorted.",1,0

458710,Kingdom Rush Frontiers,"Personally I'm with KR franchise from the very beginning (flash version) and can truly say that Kingdom Rush is one of the best Tower Defense game I've ever played.

Do I recommend Kingdom Rush series? Yes!  Why? Because this game brought me a lot of Fun, simple as that. And gaming is all about it. If you want to start your tower defense journey with this franchise, play vanilla Kingdom Rush. It's free, it's Fun and it will show you why I love this little masterpiece.

Ive been a big fan of sim racing but the lack of good racing sim on PC, makes me go for the consoles version of Forza and GT. This game would bring back sim racing genre on PC as I bet that if this game make a huge success on PC platform, others devs would want to grabe a bite on the market and we would get more sim racing for the PC.   If you want a good solid sim racing game that can go neck to neck with iRacing and rFactor but comes with better graphic, go fior this one. You wounlnt regret it.",1,0

265550,Dead Rising 3,"The best way to describe this game is to simply tell you it's a blast. That's all this game is, zombie killing galore, and there honestly isn't much more to say about it. You play as protagonist Nick Ramos. A man stuck in Los Perdidos during a zombie outbreak. The third in this universe. In his life he was a mechanic and worked with another main survivor in this game, Rhonda, at her shop. She is also extremely attractive may I add. Like no one else has made a country accent as sexy as she did in this game. But since he was a mechanic this means he is very crafty and good with his hands, which by this point we all know proves extremely useful in any situation with zombies. Which brings me to the weapons in this game... they're ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. This installment in the franchise just might have the most inventive weapons yet. Granted they might be a little overpowered and make you feel like a god but.. that's not really a bad thing is it? Well that's all subjective. There is an alternate way to play in the game in the 'Nightmare' mode. This ramps up the difficulty greatly and only allows save in the porta potties found around the map and at the end of chapters. I first tried this mode because I was told that it was the 'real way to play' but I just found it annoying. Mostly because of the frustrating save system. The added enemy challenge was welcome though. Now I also must mention the fact that this game was BUILT for the Xbone.. this is a ♥♥♥♥ port to put it nicely. It runs like crap. The cut scenes in particular. They run at horrible fps even with the best hardware. It feels like it was just ripped from the Xbone and sent to steam to sell to us. The developers put no effort in the port what so ever. But, nonetheless, if you liked the last two Dead rising games you should pick this up. Maybe wait for a sale on it? It really wouldnt hurt to wait for it but I don't think you should blow over it completely. Final score: 8/10 Pc version: 7/10",1,0

227160,Kinetic Void,"Well, with 8 or so hours on record I feel like I can write a review on something quite a few other reviewers spent less than an hour on.  Anyway, I agree with the general consensus: The ship builder side of the game is very functional, and the Workshop is full of awesome ships (and mechs even!) built by members of the playerbase that can be downloaded for your playthroughs. (After you fix them - don't forget the fact that a number of Workshop ships are technically incomplete, with not all of the subsystems set, and often with far too many subsystems than the other parts can handle. Too many hangar bays is a common example.) The learning curve for the shipbuilder is kind of steep, but like I said, quite functional.  Outside of the shipbuilder, it's cool that you can set up a randomly-generated sandbox galaxy to mess around in according to some parameters that you set during generation - namely, galaxy size and number of factions. It gives a lot of play area, though there's no guaruntee your ship (even the workshop ones) will have the warp range to reach other parts of the galaxy. There are missions, pirates who nobody cares if you go hunting, and faction-relations mechanics - all of which are good.  The thing is, outside of that it just feels bare. In 8 hours of play I've only encountered 'go hear and kill what you find' missions. I haven't delved into the economy or career mode, true, but no 'sandbox' should ever feel like there's nothing to do - and that's exactly how this game makes me feel. Sure, I can warp across the galaxy into pirate-held sectors and go to town with a downloaded Star Destroyer or HMS Warspite, sure I can rescue traders from pirate fighters and kill a smuggler or six, and sure it can be enjoyable all the same - I was giddy when I launched in my downloaded Super Star Destroyer and found it to be larger than the space station it was docked at, but all in all I can't really recommend this game.   I bought it summer of last year, expecting it to improve in time, but it really doesn't seem to have gone anywhere. Whether or not the devs are still working on it behind the scenes I'm not really sure. I am sure though that this game has huge potential, but as it is now fails to live up to it. Right now all it's really good for is destroying everything you see. While enjoyable by itself, it gets old when you run into an enemy or 6 using the same ship as you, and that ship is some form of battleship which had until then slaughtered helpless foes. Especially when those enemies are pirates.   I have limited hard drive space, and I am afraid that I'm going to have to uninstall to make room for other, more fleshed-out games. I might still come back to it eventually, see how it's changed (if at all). I just hope the potential here doesn't remain wasted.",-1,0

405970,Flat Kingdom Paper's Cut Edition,"For a retro gamer such as myself this is a sweet little title with a rich story-line that allows for some casual weekend gaming. It's reminiscent of some Nintendo 64 classic RPG/Adventure titles with a flavor of it's own. It's also got the potential for sequel development so I'm looking forward to seeing how the game grows.  If you want a little more insight into the game, I did an interview with the developers that's been posted here:  Battle Of 2D Versus 3D? Here’s the “Flat” Answer  [blog.indiegala.com] .  I recommend this game. If you're looking for a hardcore challenge or a deeply enchanting story, this probably isn't the title.

Have you ever played I Wanna Be The Guy? You know, that game that likes to randomly kill you before you have time to react? That's how Half-Life feels. Explosions come out of nowhere and blow you up constantly, sometimes you have to just book it through tons of enemies, and sometimes the map layout was so twisty and confusing I had no idea where to go.  Not to mention you can play the whole game for free through Sven Co-op so...  EDIT (so people will stop yelling at me): THIS IS MY OPINION. MINE. NOT YOURS.

It does stink how I had bought the game on my Xbox for it to just become free. I hope it becomes popular again and also gets to a point where I can get each character and monster for free at one point for more variety. I at least hope that at least all of the monsters will become free so it doesn't become repetitive as the monster. In my opinion I think the only things that should cost money in this game are the skins, not the Hunters and not the Monsters. I will re-download Evolve for myself on my Xbox and see what happens in the future, but I do hope that if this game falls again that they will just focus on a whole new game with a better experience that would last for years.",1,0

Cons: - Needs more weapons - Needs more research trees - Needs more roles - Needs a hangar, instead of just one ship - Needs multiple saves - Needs an even bigger end game with mega-weapons  Neut: - Needs more exploration - Needs use for mining instead of just selling the rocks  It's pretty cool tho and is a must try for people who like top-down space shooters/trader/etc.",1,0

When you split, I feal like its very hard to control where your going. Viruses split exetremely farm, and when you get hit, its nearly impossible for you to survive. Another thing is the levels, it feals to me that the XP you have to earn to level up goes up too quickily, you zoom through about levels 1 through 12, after that, you have to play an entire game to level up once.

374320,DARK SOULS™ III,"It's pretty neat, although I wouldn't consider it the best entry in the Souls games. I'm just going to list things that I enjoyed and things that I thought were done better in the previous games. So let's start with the graphics, which look very familiar if you played Bloodborne. It's definitely an upgrade to the previous Souls games and the locations are absolutely stunning so there is really nothing I could complain about in this departement. The combat is a bit faster now which is fine by me. There is also Weapons Art and the the addition of the Focus Points which I, as a UGS wielder never actually used. Perhaps it has its uses for some situations but I never encountered those. Poise is drastically changed now, I could wear full Havels and become staggered by some rat or a starved dog. I'm not sure what From was thinking when implemanting those changes. Other then that the PvE and PvP are very enjoyable and there are a lot more people to play with. The game difficulty swaps around a bit. For instance the only challenging area was Archdragon Peak for me. Maybe it's just me and after 3 games I already got used to the concept and gameplay so that's why I would consider Dark Souls 1 as the most challenging of them all. Game seems a lot shorter even for someone who has to '100% every area available'. Steam says that I spend aroung 120 hours on DS1, DS2 and Bloodborne yet I have 'only' 50 on DS3 and I almost finished it. All in all the game has it flaws here and there but in the end it's very enjoyable and something that I would recommend on buying to someone who enjoyed the previous games. It's also probably the best game to start with if you want to play the Soulsborne games as it seems a bit more beginner friendly.

For a game with a lot of jumping, the double-jumping and 'butterfly' dashing are polished and surprisingly beautiful. (I don't normally look for beautiful jumping in a game.)     The weapons/combat mechanics are creative and tight.     Hysteria is awesome.   The Cons section is longer but that's mainly because it needs more explanation.  Cons    The 2D cutscenes pale in comparison to the 3D part of the game. I enjoy the game more skipping the 2D parts. They do fill in the backstory, but then there's already plenty of aural cues that already do that.     The main game is filled with mini-games that add nothing and feel like cheap filler. I would have rathered the extra labor be spent adding more variety to the main game.     Many of the maps are stretched far longer than they have content to justify. Ironically, I would have more hours in this game if it was shorter: I haven't played it through as frequently because parts of it tend to drag.     Many of the battles are too compartmentalized. You jump some platforms, arrive at a group of enemies, switch to battle mode, fight them until they are dispatched, then platform jump over to the next batch of enemies. In the original game the enemies were more organically scattered about and integrated into the world, similar to its DOOM/Quake roots. That resulted in more integrated platforming and fighting.     It has EA DRM. Normally I don't buy EA games because of this, but I'd jump through even more hoops to play this game.   One note, this game was made for a controller.

Black squares that show up across the screen, and it just doesn't generally run as smooth as the main campaign. But hey, its DLC, so whatever.  Buy this game if you watched and loved Alien.

Avoid this one and for a game that gets Early Access, check out Prison Architect.",-1,1

394230,Battleborn,"I really wanted to like this game. I got a lot of fun out of Smite and this looked like a great FPS version of that with the added bonus of Borderlands-style art and humor.  But this game is a waste of money. The PvE can be enjoyable the first or second time through but after that, it is a complete snorefest. And it's pretty much required for PvP because it's the best way to get gear. Just buy gear packs with the in-game currency, you say? Well in one of the most inane decisions of game development history, the better packs (with a higher chance for good gear) are LOCKED BEHIND A LEVEL REQUIREMENT. That makes no sense at all. I've got like 20k credits that I just won't spend because I don't have the gear packs unlocked that have high chances of epic/legendary gear.  The PvP is a complete joke. It's not the mechanics of it that suck, but the realization of the game. The playerbase on PC is abysmal, which results in terrible matchmaking experiences. You'll be a fresh player with little going on for you going against people with 150+ hours logged. These people have better gear than you do. These people have all of their helix mutations unlocked. And they have experience playing the game. It isn't fun. In the 10 hours or so of PvP I've played, I have had exactly ONE fair match. Otherwise it is just one team stomping the other and then an 8-10 minute surrender.  Balance is ♥♥♥♥. Some heroes are just completely faceroll and those are often the heroes being picked by those people with 150+ hours. They just ♥♥♥♥ all over the new players and the match is completely ruined. You can't even just pick those heroes and be on an equal field because again, you won't have the good gear for them and you won't have the helix choices unlocked. So you'll just be a lesser version and you'll still get beat out.  This game will die. It's a shame but there's too much bad to save it because the playerbase is going to quickly atrophy to the point where good match making will be impossible. Save your money and pass on this one.",-1,1

474210,BUTCHER,"Butcher is very very hard, but especially so in the first couple of hours. At first every level will seem nearly impossible, but you'll notice your skills improve. I just love the built in natural progression-no upgrades, just you getting better at the game. It becomes a motivator to keep going at what could otherwise be a boring march into death after death. This is the game's biggest problem, though. It's barely fun for awhile. You really have to put effort and time in to get to a point where you're gliding through levels. That may seem unimaginable at first, but I beat the first two difficulties in just a dozen of hours, and I really suck. You WILL get better the more you play, you just need to be prepared how brutal it'll be to begin with.  Butcher has some good gory style, but what bugs me about it's presentation is how bland the enviroments are. Aside from the neat jungle bit, the areas all more or less look exactly alike, and even the jungle is barely all that different. Still, Butcher is overall a well put together game if you can get past the initial difficulty curve.",1,0

That is almost exactly (not really) what this game is. While you play it, you think to yourself that something cool, or just SOMETHING is gonna happen, but it never does. All you do is walk around and investigate... sorry, investigate is the wrong word... look at stuff until you find out why no one is home. It is frustrating. And is that storyline enticing? It is not. I will give it up to some of the 90's nostalgia that was in this game, but that is it.  I just wanted to add the Raj quote because it is better than this game.",-1,0

Want to take on the world's hardest boss? etc. The choice is yours.   The game is separeted into two parts - Hardmode, and Pre-Hardmode. Originaly, there was only Pre-Hardmode, but the awesome developers added at least 100% more content 2 years after the game's official release. There are plenty of Mobs, Weapons, Armors, Ores, Vanity items and Block types, all for you to be creative with.   Personally, I've played it through (from scratch)   3      Edit: 4    times. It's that awesome, and each playthrough has sucked a fantastic 100hr out of my life.   This game has, in my opinion, the best cost to entertainment ratio out of any game on Steam. Buy it!",1,0

302510,Ryse: Son of Rome,"It may not be the greatest game of the 'character action' style beat 'em up genre, but it is definitely the prettiest. The gameplay is somewhat shallow and repetitive but if you are looking for a brainless action game full of fighting, blood and severed limbs this game has it. It is fun killing enemies and having '300' style combat moments, but I can see it getting old for some. The cinematics are well voiced and well animated, plus look absolutely stunning. The story is okay and was enough to keep me playing albeit very short as I was able to complete the game in about 5 hours. So is it the best game ever? no, not many games are, but it is a game I enjoyed and that is what I play games for, enjoyment. There may be much better games in the genre as I said but if you like roman or medieval type history and want to shield bash and sword play your way around then at a nice discounted price I recommend this game.

316010,Magic Duels,"First and foremost, I am glad Magic is playable online! Im not forced to play Magic with a bunch of random people irl, and not forced to go to a desiganted place. I remember the one and only time I went to a friday night Magic draft with my bro, and the ♥♥♥♥ing place smelt like ♥♥♥! Come on people! There's a reason why soap exists!  Second, this version of Magic is great since we dont have to keep playing different versions, and that we get to keep the cards we earn for future decks.  I'm not an avid Magic player, but I do enjoy the game and since this FREE version of Magic came out, I have been playing as much as I can to earn coins for booster packs. It is a grind at times since the Zendikar set came out, because despite my reluctance to affirm the complainers of this game, the AI seems to have about a 80% chance of using a U/W deck which is all control. But I take it as an opportunity to construct a deck which can work around it using a W/G deck (♥♥♥♥ing elves..I hate elves), and Ive been doing pretty good so far with an win average of 75%.   I have not read all the negative reviews, but most of them consist of nonsense complaints about how much they suck at the game, and how they cant win since the AI primarily uses the U/W control deck, or how they cant use 4 of the same cards so the game is 'different'. IM ♥♥♥♥ING GLAD that this time round, WotC decided to use thier brains and make gameplay restricted to a set amount of cards, which entails a faster game played. I dont wanna spend an hour playing against some ♥♥♥♥ing fat p.o.s, who spent $500 on this game.  I dont want to spend anymore time typing this review, but this game deserves more respect than its getting from some of these ♥♥♥♥tards, who've spent less than 10 hours and complain out the ♥♥♥ about the UI.

From sound design to the sprawling maps you do battle on, there is just something about this game that has kept me coming back for more. From charging bayonets in hand as machine gun fire rips through your comrades and whizzes by your head, or sitting in a fox hole with a Mosin picking off germans as they cross a street, or finally reaching an objective only to hear the bellow of the enemy's artillery cannons as the shells begin to fall ripping you and your teammates limb from limb.  The game isn't without it's occasional bugs, but even then the action is so fierce and one of kind, to the saturated fps genre, that they're easy to look past.

To be honest, this is one of the funnest RTS I've ever played, the Eastern Front armies are very balanced as of now because most people have figured out how to combat everything.

356330,NA,"There is so much wrong and so much they tried to make right, but went wrong. I'll start with the biggest things: The monster hunter style gameplay and using the dragomon to fight other dragomon.  The monster hunter gameplay is somewhat there, monsters strike anything in front of it, and so do you in melee range. The main problem with this is that when you attack your rooted in place and does not give you enough time to get away from being attacked, and right around the 30s lvl, that is an important thing cause the mobs start dealing quite abit of damage that can stack quickly.  The using dragomon to fight other dragomon (as advertised in their video) is not even possible and you can only use your monster pets in battlegrounds after getting an extreamly high rating. Even using them is risky as when you die using them they permamently die, which throws all the hard work you put into them away.  There are some good things I like about this game though, the fishing aqua lords quick time events are really nice way to keep you on your toes. When you do get a chance to ride monsters they are pretty epic feeling (with the exception of 1-2). I also like the idea of aquiring titles and leveling proffesions giving you stat rewards.  There is one other main problem that this game shares with Aura Kingdom (made from same company) and that is so much daily stuff to do that it litterally takes hours to get threw. For example a lvl 29 character (me) took about 4-5 hours to do all dailies available, which is INSANE!!! There is the argument that you do not have to do them, but to get the stat boosts to keep up with higher leveled areas makes it more manditory than it should be.  All in all, I feel like this game is still incomplete, like it is in it's alpha stages. I really wanted to like this game it had alot of promise, but there is just so much negative that I cannot overlook.",-1,0

Boy was i wrong, this game sucked me in from the very start and i cant wait to do another playthru to do some of the smaller quests and try and take my luck at other pary comps.  Absolute must buy when the avernum set is on sale  Graphics 7/10 lets just be real youre not buying this game for the graphics. They are very simple but get the job done.  Story 9/10 You quickly realize that this game has huge depth. There are so many locations and areas way across the map that tie into each other.  Battle System 9/10 The battle system is actually pretty simple but is very addicting and requires some decent strategy for harder battles. Only real complaint is that sometimes it is a pain in the ♥♥♥ to select a gride close to enemies if that enemy in question is larger and blocks that grid.  Leveling and skill tree 8/10 The leveling and skills system is pretty basic but has just enough depth to allow some pretty decent character development. The system uses a 3 pronged system which isnt too bad. Provided me with some interesting character combos that i liked.  Overall 9/10 With the combination of the outstanding setting and story with a good battle system and decent character custimization Avernum Escape From the Pit will provide you with many hours of excitement.",1,0

(allowing you to get the full collection faster) - the gold grind is not overwhelming and the starter deck you get is decent allowing you to build decks to win games and grind for gold. - connection issues were solved within the first few days of launch, things run smoothly now. i have not encountered any connection related bugs or card collection errors. - single player campaign is challenging in places but also sets a good example of the varried decks / archtypes possible with the game. - 2 headed giant is fun,  but does not reward any gold for wins.  2hg rewards 20g for a win. -- 2hg has a number of bugs that cause the match to stall leaving the only option being to leave the match (concede). some of these bugs are triggered from players exploiting timer bugs and some are bugs in the game itself / netcode. - deck builder wizard does a halfway decent job of auto building decks for those unfamiliar with deck building.  It's free and a good intro to the world of magic or a fun place for the filthy casuals (like myself) who cant spend money on real cards or mtgo.  -sorely needs a form of communication during multiplayer battles with humans, even if it's just emotes like hearthstone it would add a degree of fun to the game. -have encountered a bug when trying to complete a daily quest; black/green deck wizard creation crashes when auto completeing and 'white noise' crashes when adding 4th card to the deck. haven't been able to get past the bug so far. -sometimes bugs with gold rewards not being credited with wins and completion of quests.",1,1

318430,Squishy the Suicidal Pig,"Never got past the first level in this game, so instead Im just gonna post a pie recipe for my review.  Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",1,1
34330,Total War: SHOGUN 2,"There is no comparing this to other games in the Total War world. It blows away all other titles and it obviously beat Rome II which turned out to be a content limited DLC money grab riddled with glitches, lag problems and graphical issues that have largely been unfixed as they keep adding content without fixing problems.   The naval combat in Shogun 2 is the best RTS naval combat simulator of its class. FOS DLC added great content (gladly pay for that expansion which adds an all new campaign and many new factions, troops and so on.) The naval combat gets cannons and armor. Artillery and guns on land is a nice retreat from melee and archers. There is something very fascinating with line fire combat.   Sieging castles feels a bit awkward at times and sometimes the AI won't surrender when they should. I had an enemy army of 2000+ down to its last 20 men and they wouldn't run away. Other times they run away before getting close, a few arty shells into their ranks and the entire army flees.   It is good fun, my hours speak for themselves, I have beaten all three campaigns with nearly all the factions. I have played online, fought the historical battles and even tested my computer by pitting armies of 10's of thousands against each other...this game is solid.",1,0

97100,NA,"Section 8: Prejudice is a surprisingly decent, if not painfully short, FPS. The main campaign will probably only run you about 3-4 hours or so, with a decent amount of that time stuck in loading screens.  It feels like an attempt to replicate the feel of the Halo franchise in a way, by making your characters kind of 'floaty', as well as everything having a general 'Halo'-like feel to it, from the character design to the weapons.   The story, however, is rather lackluster, and doesn't really have any memorable moments to it at all. Something about aliens, or a rebel task force... or... Something. Nothing really sticks with you. The cut scenes really don't add any substance to the game at all.  Graphically, the game actually looks really nice. Nothing amazing, but definitely on par with what I would expect from something that's trying very hard to replicate the look and feel of Halo. The environments are polished all the characters look really amazing.   I'd have to say that one of the biggest flaws this game suffers from is that it's using Games for Windows Live, which poses a huge detriment to actually enjoying the game. I made the mistake of forgetting what account I used to register the game with initially, and now I can never fully enjoy the game again, as GFWL does not let you access many features of the game without being logged in, nor does it let you save your Campaign Mode progress. So if you ever forget your GFWL password, you'll never be able to just jump back into the game; you'll have to play it from start to finish in one run.  The multiplayer is decent, for what it's worth, though I had difficulty finding anybody to actually play with. The actual gameplay in the multiplayer mode was okay. Nothing I'd ever look back on and say 'Boy, I want to do that again!', but it wasn't bad, either. Just like the rest of the game, it was just 'okay'.  I'd say if you want to play a decent sci-fi FPS, it wouldn't hurt to pick up this game. Just don't expect this to be game-changing or anything.",1,0

The graphics are great (considering the game uses the Unreal engine) and the gameplay is pretty nice too. You can use a wide variety of characters and skins for said characters. The voice acting is stellar. WBID unlocks are okay, and the controls are actually pretty easy to learn. (the key combo for special moves can get a little hard to memorize however, you may have to write down the key combos)  My final verdict on this game shall be a 9.75/10.

But at the time of writing there is a design choise that makes or brakes the game, and that is the constant head 'bobbing' or 'swaying'. To say that this is realistic is to say that humans have no neck muscles, it would be understandable to have this effect while running or sprinting, but not while walking.

244710,Shelter 1,"For all the saviors of the galaxies, legendary heroes, and lone hopes for humanity that populate most video games, developers have been ignoring one of the world's fiercest protectors: mothers, and their love for their childen.  Shelter  casts you as a badger, sole guardian of her five cubs, who must set forth against the harsh world to try and lead her children to safety. Through storms and wildfires, your determination will be tested and the lives of your underlings repeatedly put in danger, as you travel on an intense journey that not everyone will be able to survive.   Shelter  isn't a game you sit down to relax to; it's a harrowing adventure that at times is truly terrifying do to how emotionally taxing it becomes. Without any dialogue, no hints at a story or exposition of any sort, I became extremely attached to the little badgers I was trying to protect. Prancing around and hopping excitedly when stumbling upon a bit of food, they are almost entirely oblivious to the dangers around them and their joyful manner makes it even more saddening when you inevitably lose one. Death is all around you in  Shelter  and once a cub is gone, it's gone for good. There are no checkpoints, no extra lives, and no second chances; this helplessness is what makes it such an intense experience, and is something I don't believe I have ever felt in a game.  Controlling your badger is simple by design. You can sprint and sneak to catch prey (and avoid being it), pull food from the grounds to feed your children and keep them strong enough to continue on, and often have to rely on stealth to get past hostile animals by sticking to the tall grass. There honestly isn't a whole lot to the gameplay, but that's because it intentionally is not the game's focus. Developer  Might and Delight  didn't try to make a great 'game', it made an experience, one that is intended to make you feel something meaningful, and is an exemplary example for games as an art form.  Regardless of how you view the argument,  Shelter  is an astoundingly unique pilgrimage through a gorgeous papercraft world, with a masterful score that affects every moment of the game. It's over in just over an hour and will likely leave you with an empty feeling after the credits role, but I think this was what the developers wanted. Nothing is ever perfect in life, and  Shelter  boldly reflects this fact without taking away your every hope. While certainly not without dispute and it's own share of problems,  Shelter  made me feel a sense of connection and responsibility that few if any other games have managed to accomplished, and I believe is something that you should be taking note of.

50300,Spec Ops: The Line,"This was a surprisingly engaging game. It looks generic, but Nolan North's voice acting is a nice touch and the story is a change from other military shooters. It's not original by any means, but the characters are interesting enough to play this one until the end. It takes about 8 hours to complete, and the game is well optimized so high frame rates can be achieved if V-Sync is turned off. The graphics are amazing, as well as the audio. The gameplay is a standard third person cover game, but it works perfectly so that's not necessarily a bad thing. Ammo is scarce at times, so you'll find yourself picking up enemy weapons a lot in order to have a functional weapon.   I'd recommend buying this game, it's not a Call of Duty ripoff - but instead more character focused... a story based around the effects of war and the hard choices that are made.

No matter your skill, It gets harder as you go along, so you're guaranteed to face a challenge at some point. As for faults, personally, if any, is going to have to be with Multiplayer. Anybody can join, beginners or advanced, so each time is different. But, it lacks challenge. A team-member can be reckless and set off all the guards and what not, or everyone can go off and do their own thing, and the mission can still be completed, I wish it could be more along the lines of, one wrong move and your entire mission will fail, hence forcing teamwork.

Classes can be changed after picking one so that the player can see and try out which class he'll enjoy the most.

Think job simulator, but with a bit more personality and a lot better lighting or bump mapping effects.   This 'game' is a glimpse at true genius, and insanity, and I would love the designers to expand on it and sell a full product as that really was... fun!

346940,Shadowrun: Hong Kong - Extended Edition,"Very good writing on some of the companion characters. The main storyline feels a bit forced upon the characters, but that's not particularly different from the previous installations (the Seattle and Berlin stories).   Very good improvement on Matrix exploration; overall, the missions seem less about world-saving and more about trying to get by. Would definitely recommend to RPG lovers.   For those who don't know about the Shadowrun setting -- it's a cyberpunk world with magic, mostly, in the dark setting of 80's Gibson cyberpunk, with megacorporations controlling the world, and shadowy protagonists trying to survive while getting entangled in stories much larger than themselves. Good writing, although sometimes predictable.",1,0

65980,Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth,"Good mechanics, good diplomacy, excellent tech tree. But... Lack of buildings, cold feel, and long term games loosing the spark. Why? Because it simply gets repetitive, I feel like there's something missing. I think you shouldn't be able to upgrade troops, instead you should get new ones as the game evolves. If a civilization has one upgrade over you, you will get smashed in combat. Aliens are really painful at the start of the game it happens often that you get completely invaded and can't do anything. And there are no luxuries in the game. I also feel like some items from Civ 5 are drastically missing. Like boats, for example, there are only two main naval units. Also, wonders aren't that important anymore. It feels like building them is pretty much useless. But the main aspect that is missing is population interaction. There is no more religion and no more great persons, no world congress and so little Civilizations! Just so many features that have been cut off from Civ 5. As a cherry on the cake, the graphical aspect makes the game feel really cold and lonely. Some people love it, but others, like me find it to be diverting me to other occupations. This game will keep you entertained for some time, but you play a few games and then simply get bored of what it offers, which is my case. 50 hours in and I simply don't feel like clicking play now...",-1,1

286100,You Have to Win the Game,"Its bright colors, tight controls, and challenging-without-being-impossible platforming make this game a  true gem . Its tribute to the games of the bygone CGA era shows the passion the developer has for games and technology. Personally, I preferred the 'red' color scheme over the 'pink', and I also played with the CRT setting off. The only thing I felt was missing was background music. This is understandable though as many 80s PC games couldn't push out more than sound effects due to technical limitations. Playing this game has sky-rocketed its sequel,  'Super Win the Game'  to the  TOP  of my Wishlist. It is just that damn fun. Also, the typing sound effect heard during the Credits 'backstory' is soothing, second only to Morgan Freeman reading the phone book.",1,0
261180,Lethal League,"This game is the most fun I have had in 1 sitting for a long while Before going into detail notes:  - I played this with a only a PS2 style controller so far - The Mac and Linux versions of this game are in beta and currently available to everyone who opts into it from the game properties menu  Now assuming you understand the basic mechanics of hit the other player with the ball but don’t get hit Here are some keypoints of the game Ball tagging -You cannot be hit by the ball if you hit it last (It will be highlighted in your team/player color)  ^ this also might cause confusion if you switch around player slots allot or just use to the default Red color given to Player 1 (This mechanic can be turn off but it might lead all sorts of weirdness since you now have to watch out for your own ball)   You have 3 basic attacks, 1 character specific special attack and 1 hidden protection mechanism when hitting a ball Basics:  -Basic hit: you hit the ball (duh). You increase the ball speed by one and most importantly while its being hit you can control the direction you want the ball to travel in Charge attacks Note: Hold down the button to charge your attack to increase the ball speed when hit (can only be double its speed + you are a sitting duck while doing this)  -Power attack/Smash attack: same key as basic attack but with a catch, to achieve this you need to be midair and hold down a directional button of left, right and down Note: you cannot hit the ball going through you unless its taged as your ball (don’t be do something silly)] Note: This and charge attack doubles the ball current speed  -Blunt: Rips the ball of most of all its momentum and makes it travel upwards at the speed of anybody who tosses a ball moderately into the air to catch it again.  Notes: Tags the balls as your own Key component to mess up the pacing for your own benefit YOU CAN CONTROL THE DIRECTION THE BALL FLIES TOWARDS The ball will resume full speed when it hits the ground but will only travel in a up and down motion ONLY use this when you have an opening due to the other players can take the ball for themselves while its midair  -HIDDEN PROTECTION THING Parrying: When you are hit lag (when time freezes while hitting the ball) you can press the blunt button to create a parry which can stun your enemy players who attempt to hit the ball while you use a parry. More on it here (Its not in the tutorial)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brcsQfp7WQE   --&gt; I’m not going to spoil the character specific attacks for you because its more fun to find it out for yourself and see how it tie into the characters personality &lt;--     What are the other actions you have availible  -Jump – You can control your jump height  -Taunt – 2 types Taunts,  Press and release taunt = Gesture + VO taunt (Can be charge because why not) Direction key + tap of the taunt key = Worded message Up= Wow Down = Bring it Left = Ops Right = Nice  If you want to learn more about the mechanics this guide will be more than enough to suit your needs  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=307010458     Graphics The game is admittedly lack luster and the characters are kind of generic but it holds up for what it doing  Soundtrack/OST: Its very “flat-headed” electric music. Not much going up, not much going down. Just everything being cool and casual  Example:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jGGctcKiek   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YasRoOFQuY  Playlist for the OST  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFeuvN1IQa_qei1GZQ-tPvaPmAN5Z-R3r    Online play : I haven’t touch it yet due to not having much interest with playing with random sub its there and fully functional (Not sure if online supports bots)  Offline play: To set the point crystal clear, the AI in this game is very competent (even on low levels) 2 Types of modes to play in Verses and Challenge Verses: This is where you and your peers duke it out in the battle arena, very quick loading between matches and 3 game modes available Free for all – Set stocks or time limited, last one on or the biggest MVP wins Teams – Same as before but you can have a buddy of human/machine or you can have a 3v1, it’s up to you Strikers – You’re playing soccer with a baseball, you cannot accidentally score for the enemy team and the targets on each side takes up a decent part of the wall  Challenge mode: I would call this alternative training or the game’s “story mode”, in layman terms, you pick your characters and go up against a certain number of progressionaly harder foes with a limited amount of continues   Conclusion I would recommended this game to casual as well as veterans mostly due to its “easy to pick up but hard to master” nature Also this game IMO will be great for parties or if you have friends over and you want to create scene where people are cheering on how intense the game is becoming Sorry but I haven’t proof read this review. I’ll maybe do it latter but atm I just want to get it out of the way and off my list of things to do",1,0

It has way more content (all the dlc`s on day one) and things for community to create. Create a Diva is back baby! The AI is way more fast and aggressive thanks to this matches feel more real. The animations are little better and the guys move really good and realistic. The new limited reversal system is a welcome change (no more reversals spamming). New circle submission system is challenging and I prefer it over the constant button smash. Sadly the graphics are stuck in the same place. The game does look good but we still far behind EA sport game as far as characters look. I also miss some excellent songs from the last year WWE game. I was coming to this game with high expectations, bought it on the launch day and I'm not disappointed.  This feels like real matches, wrestlers moves like they should - good job 2k!",1,0

310080,Hatoful Boyfriend,"I had always secretly wanted this game just by how ridiculous this game is. Evidently there was good reason, as you progress through the game, making choices, interacting with possible husbandoves, and taken twists and turns, the experience overall is ridiculous.  It is a fun game, and great that it offers a fast forward option when you want to skip sections you have read already (such as the beginning). Progressing through the story isn't terribly long for most endings, and trying to get each birdies ending is fairly straight forward. This game is easily replayable, especially when you unlock more endings, and can easily get you hooked. I suggest buying it on sale, however full price isn't terrible either. My only quarrel is sometimes getting a full ending for a character may not always be clear cut, and thus having to restart a new game may be cumborsome, and one of the endings took a little longer than I would have liked (regardless of how interesting it got). It's a great game and earns and 8 out of 10 stars. Something Everbirdie would love, so go find your husbandove  P.S. I'm putting this game as a nomination for The “I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award” Award. This game, with little advertising, is actually a very fun game, even for those who don't typically enjoy visual novels. I'll update my review if my nominee changes.",1,1

10090,Call of Duty: World at War,"The Call of Duty franchise was great until this game came out, where do i begin...  Pros:  Historical accuracy and information is much more than the previous games.  You get to play as an American captive in the Pacific Theatre, which was never done in the previous two games  You can throw a activated grenade back at the enemy if you are quick enough.  On that note, you get far less ammo than the previous two games, making the game more realistic  You can reload the M1 Grand without having to deplete the entire clip.  Cons:  The voice acting is disgusting. It sounds like it was tacked on as an afterthought rather than integrated into the actual game. It sounds like Treyarch hired the actors from b-reel movies.  The cinematics don't show a lot of game play, They are also too 'active' and they do not give us enough time to let us understand what we are supposed to learn from the Pacific Theatre, for example.  The FOV is horrendous, and while there is mod support, a game this advanced should have come standard with an FOV Slider.  The sound quality in general is not of the same fidelity as it was in the previous two games. Granted the engine is more 'advanced,' I liked the clip ejection 'ping' from the M1 Grand from the previous two games.  Conclusion:  I am thankful I got this was a part of the CoD War Chest bundle over Christmas 2015 rather than full price. This game is not worth your money since it takes so many steps back and tries to become an interactive movie instead. Very disappointed by the quality of this game overall. At least it looks pretty.",-1,0
322910,"Warhammer 40,000: Regicide","This Warhammer 40k game is actually alot better than it would seem on paper. It is a chess game but with ranged combat....Sooo think the battle chess game from the original star wars trillogy or the wizards chess from harry potter, because there are animations for taking pieces as you would in chess. Next throw in that ranged combat mechanic I mentioned earlier. It's a part of the game that refreshes chess in general, throw in some unlockable abillities to suit nearly any situation and you have a game that looks very blah like alot of other 40k games but at its core is actually far better than it should be.   Pros: Fun to play, like tooo fun.  Terminator's (rook peice in chess) grab the enemy peices head and explode it into a brief blood fountain, kinda like popping a zit!   Cons: No one seems to play multiplayer as of 04/09/16 get ready to grind for extra skins which seem to be purely aestetic.  I give this game 8/10 blood fountains!",1,1

Pros The Combat is really good but not too easy where it's just buttion mashing. The cutscenes and art in the levels look really well done. There's about 20 combos you get by leveling up.

379720,DOOM,"It's Doom. Like old school original Doom. Get a gun, go into a room, music comes on, kill kill kill kill. Fun. I remember playing the Beta of the original Doom way back in the day when the monsters were stationary but could still attack, I spent probably hundreds of hours with the original and DCK building levels. Doom and Doom2 are similar to this Doom. Doom3 was more of an exploration FPS with tunnels and corridors and hallways - this goes back to the original roots. There are still puzzles, keycards and other item hunting on the side - some classic levels here and there. But mostly it's about going into rooms, triggering a hoard of demons, killing them all, moving onto the boss level fights, killing them all, moving through the base and killing everything, moving through hell and killing everything..... fun fun fun - very frantic at times, yet good for stress relief   Details are great and amazing and if you remember back in the day, the original games, you'll see how far gaming has come over the years. I haven't tried any online or the built-in map maker yet, I did a full play through and went back for more at higher difficulties. Weapons and armor have upgrades to help you stay alive while killing more demons faster but it seems like no matter what upgrade path you choose, in the end you will upgrade everything the same way. A lot of great details in the graphics, even on my Evga 770FTW with 4gb on an i7 920 I can crank the details up pretty far and override the settings to display 2k and it runs smoothly and quick - a few stutters in large fights but that is expected.  I'd give it either 8 out of 10 or 9 out of 10, perhaps both. Hard to say right now since there are so many features I haven't yet messed with, no DLC, no online play, no map maker - so I'm sticking with an 8 for now. Great game for those that have been with Doom for years, probably a good game for those who never played before. Frantic action shooter survival game set on Mars and in Hell. Adds to the mystery and backstory from the earlier games and the movie that Dwayne was in. Sadly, nobody smells what he is cooking these days",1,0
225260,Brütal Legend,"Much of the enjoyment of the game is the music selection and orchestration. I have youtube playthroughs of many of the missions (sadly a lot were hit with claims, but w/e) and in putting them together I'm struck by how appropriate the music choices are for the sequences. It's not *just* heavy metal in the soundtrack, but it is all essentially rock. And it's *always* appropriate.  The story is well written. Virtually all the stories in Tim Schafer games are excellent. The gameplay can feel repetative because it's not a hardcore brawler or a hardcore RTS or a hardcore pikmin/overlord. It has all of these bits that come together with lots of diverse forms of play. The open world combat spans the gamut from 'yeah, I can solo this easy' to 'omg run away!' There are small encounter missions with minigames and just out-and-out combat. There's lots of landmarks to find that explain the world and lore.  I daresay you can liken it to the GTA/SR games. They're terrible driving games. They're terrible shooters. They're terrible at everything *except* writing and providing a vast world to explore and screw around in. In sum, though, it provides a fun experience.  If you actually *hate* rock music, it's possible you have a bad time. Not because the game depends on it, but because Brutal Legend also draws on a lot of the same tropes. The landscapes are out of metal covers from the 70s and 80s. The backstory *is* Metal. I think, though, if you're open enough to playing the game at all, you'll be fine with it.  I *love* this game. ffs... I figure out tabs for some of the music from the OST.  I think you'll be able to get over your 'not a fan'ness of metal and enjoy the game.  One last thing, if you love Jack Black, you'll be a bit disappointed, as his character is not as Jack Black as some Jack Blacks you might have seen. If you hate Jack Black, you'll be happy to know that his character is not as Jack Black as some of the Jack Blacks you might have seen.",1,0

220780,Thomas Was Alone,"I bought this in the HumbleBundle for $1, I was going on a long flight so I decided to download all of the smaller games in my library which my laptop could handle. I didn't expect to like this game, I'm quite picky when it comes to games, but I booted this up. I started playing the first level and I couldn't put it down until I finished it, even after I touched down. The visuals were pleasing, the narrator was amazing, the music was pretty, the puzzles were fun and at times challenging. All in all I really enjoyed it and I'd give it a 10/10.  I couldn't not give a game a 10/10 if it made me emotionally attached to shapes...  Also probably the fist time I didn't skip a narration or intro in a game.",1,0

20900,The Witcher: Enhanced Edition,"As this is the first entry of Geralt's gaming appearances, and CDProjektRed's first published product, it can at times feel a little janky. Bioware's Aurora2007 engine contributes to that jankiness a bit as well. For anyone that's played Neverwinter Nights (the original, not the f2p mmo), it kind of feels similar to that. The combat system is odd and tends to be a little bit difficult to get used to, but it serves as only a tool to let you indulge in the weird and wonderful world of The Witcher. Like all the other entries of the series, it's filled with great characters and a story that is echelons above most RPGs.   All in all, this is a rough gem that exceeds its value by far.

332200,Axiom Verge,"Aaah, Axiom Verge. It's been on my wishlist for quite a while now, and I never caught it going on sale. At first, I was a little reluctant to drop $20 on an indie game; a baseless, foundless reluctance.   This game is AWESOME; That's an understatement, BTW. The developer CLEARLY understands the target audience; the execution of this game is flawless. From pixel 1, I was engaged, entertained, challenged (but not frustrated), and taken aback at the quality of this production. Everything is flawless; the execution, the scenario, the music (oh, that wonderful soundtrack; music is the artwork of time, and graphics are the artwork of space), the artwork, EVERYTHING fits like a finely-tuned jigsaw puzzle. The only exception to this might be the confusing/clunky Grappling controls, but it's a very, VERY minor nit-picky thing at the extreme.   This game caters to anyone who liked Super Metroid. If that game holds a special place in your memories, this game is the game Nintendo SHOULD have produced DECADES ago as a sequel. I promise, if you liked SM, you will like this game equally as much, if not moreso, thanks to the larger variety of levels, and the awesome soundtrack.   The passion that went into this game shows. I cannot say enough good things about this game; I sincerely hope to see a sequel or even a new variation of this game in the future. Thank you for reading, and a big thanks to the Developer for making this WONDERFUL homage to a beloved game idea!",1,0
323580,Jotun: Valhalla Edition,"Between the epic scale, wonderful animation, inventive boss battles, and a soundtrack worth keeping on spotify for ages to come, Jotun cements itself as a pioneer its genre. Not only are the levels a tutorial for the amazing boss fights to follow, giving it a 'Shadow of the Colossus' feel, but the levels themselves are amazing to look at and a true delight to play. This game is worth recommending and playing to the end, even with incredibly difficult yet rewarding boss fights. I will say that after hours of trying to beat the final boss, the feeling of triumph is not like that of any other boss fight I've ever experienced. This game truely needs more recognition and I sincerely hope for either DLC, a sequel, or prefereably both. Good on you Thunderlotus for making a masterpiece, and I can't wait to see what else you develop.",1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Only get this if you're 100% sure what you're getting yourself into, this is not the epic instant-classic Dark Souls you know from the console, this is a horrible port that might force you into 15-60 minutes problem solving and you're going to have to fix a lot of things to make this firstly playable, secondly PC-worthy.

257120,Not The Robots,"You play as a tall robot which can squat to become less visible, moving through floors of an office, sucking in pieces of office furniture and equipment until you've met a quota.

You try not to be seen, and if you are and get killed, you start over from the beginning, and every level's layout and such is all randomized. As far as motivation, just 'doing well,' going faster, and voice recordings which talk about staplers and mundane stuff like that are all that really exist to motivate.   If that gameplay sounds really fun to you and those sources of motivation sound good to you, then you might enjoy the game. For me, however, the gameplay didn't win me over, and sans that, a game's story has to completely be incredible, so with neither of those really appealing to me, I wasn't into it and would not recommend it to anyone with tastes similar to my own.",-1,0

They also don't try hard to put jokes or fanservice, it's something that happens at the right time, making the game not cringy at all.   If you care about graphics, you could say this game is meh, but I don't care much about it.  The controllers are ok for me as well and the mechanics are really easy to learn.

Another issue, I dont know who you guys hired to make the maps but you have to tell this guy to cool it with the wall brushes, I cannot tell you how many times I try to rush my way out of a zombie filled area only to get stuck on a few steps of stairs I cannot go up because you guys added a 100 ft invisible wall to it and I die same with the zombie hitboxes I know you guys are trying to create a feeling of urgency and horror but its annoying when one zombie can block you like a brick wall it doesn't make me feel like i have a chance and its frustrating. I spawned late into a lobby only to run around for 10 minutes and die to a bobbing and weaving player zombie that took around 6 shots to the head to kill. the atmosphere is great and the models and sounds are great its a fun game overall but these things make it difficult to really enjoy.",1,1

501190,Axis Football 2016,"Since 2005, Madden has been the only football game available. Many people agree that NFL 2K5 was and still is the best football game made, but EA snatched up the exclusive rights to the NFL and has had an iron grip on the property since. As a long time player of the Madden games, I have yearned for some competition for the franchise as they really have no one to push them. While Axis Football 2016 will not dethrone Madden, it’s a heck of a good start.  Since EA holds the exclusive rights to the NFL, Axis is not allowed to use team or players names but they are allowed to have teams like the Chicago Grizzles and New England Volunteers. Luckily, the game is fully moddable and an NFL roster already exists. This also opens the door for legacy rosters which are not available in Madden.  As far as the actual gameplay goes, it is somewhat rudimentary. If you’re looking for Madden levels of fluidity and polish, you won’t find that here. This being the games’ second installment, it’s not that surprising that there are still areas to be improved upon, and the developer seems quite active on the forums and dedicated to making this series as good as possible. I really didn’t have a problem with the minor jank that the game may have, but I do hope that there are some future balancing changes. There are some easily exploitable plays on both offense (I got 26 receptions with one WR) and on defense (6 sacks with a MLB).   While I have my gripes with the game, these are all fixable, and really the game makes up for it in a big way: the passing game. When I talk about wanting competition for Madden and more innovation, the passing system in Axis is exactly what I’m talking about. Instead of having icons assigned to different receivers, you use the right thumbstick to direct where you want the ball to go. This system feels infinitely more natural than the standard icon passing since you can pass to a specific spot on the field and lead the receiver or throw it shorter if you want him to come back to the ball. This mechanic is just so intuitive and brilliant that I wouldn’t be surprised if Madden ripped it off.  Axis Football 2016 is by no means perfect, but for PC players who have been craving a proper football game this is a great start. It’s not even so much that I recommend Axis 2016 based on what it is, but rather on what the Axis franchise can become going forward. I would say that it’s worth getting the game just to support someone who is trying to innovate and do new things with a genre that has largely been stagnant for the past decade. Will Axis ever be as big as Madden? Probably not, but it doesn’t have to be either. There is enough of a solid foundation here that I am excited to see where this franchise goes if it keeps improving and listening to community feedback.",1,0
200510,XCOM: Enemy Unknown,"I had this game for PS3 and loved it, so I wanted to get a copy on my PC as well and bought it here. I don't know why, but it's only showing that I have 6.8 hours played... I have that each time I've played it at a minimum. I'm guessing that's my time played while online, I usually go offline and play mostly offline.  This game is great, I really can't describe it any other way. I do like RTS games and action games mostly, but it is just so interesting. There are various classes, weapons, armor, and other equipment, and then you choose skills for your characters when you level them. You build your base with each room having a different function, some have bonuses when built next to another room of the same type.   There's really so much to discover in this game, and you can play it at your pace. I put off attacking the alien base for so long, that I ended up having near end-game enemies by the time I did it. I probably screwed myself a bit in that way, but I was able to do it.   Beyond the base building and resource management are the missions, which are the highlight of the game. You get a squad of up to six soldiers that will either explore a downed or landed UFO, explore an abduction site, defend a city, or find a person and escort them to safety. There are also the story missions, which tend to be different than the standard missions (like attacking the alien base). For all the hours I've sunk into this game on both PC and PS3, I've never actually finished it. There are so many ways to go about it, I've restarted so many times to set myself up better to not lose any nations from the program.  The game really consists of your base and the missions. At your base you will manage your soldiers, the rooms of the base, research, buying and making equipment, managing satellites, and looking for missions. You look for missions by scanning the globe looking for UFOs or abductions taking place. When you're scanning, it accellerates time, which is required for various research and building. The missions are turn-based. You explore a map, having your soldiers move and/or use an action each turn. They can only move a certain amount of spaces and do a certain number of actions per turn. I think every mission I ever encountered required me to clear the map of aliens, even the escort missions. So for example, I have to find a dignitary and escort them to safety. I can quickly find him and escort him, but then I have to clear the map before it's done. The bonus to saving the guy quickly is that he will live, and less aliens will be on the map.  To summarize, it's really a great game no matter what type of game you like. Almost anyone can find something they like in Xcom, especially if you love sci fi and aliens.",1,0

398710,Timberman,"Timberman is a very simple game about chopping wood on a tree. You try to chop as much wood as possible without your time running out, (by not being fast enough) and you have to dodge the branches that are on the tree. It is incredibly fun to chop really fast without getting hit. There are many characters to unlock, and even some multiplayer modes. This game seems like it would just be like a 'Flappy Bird' sort of game, and in some regard, it is, but this game has quite a bit to it for what it is. I got this game for 10 cents because of a coupon, but even if you pay 1 dollar, it seems worth it.  You won't get a lot of hours in to this. It's just a little game to play for a while after a long day, and when you need something simple to kill 5 minutes. I had a good time playing this with my friend to try to unlock characters, and to beat eachother's records, and I hope anyone who buys this will enjoy it too.  I would give Timberman a 7/10. I like this game quite a bit for a simple game, but the problem is, it seems like an app that you'll play on your phone for like 5 minutes at a time. I have fun with it, and that's why its pretty high up, but it is very very simple to the point of being an app game. I recommend it. Like I said, it is a pretty fun simple game, but maybe it's not worth $1 to most people, concidering that there's probably free apps just like it.  Give it a try! [I think its worth $1, but it might not be worth that amount for most people!]",1,0

321710,Battle Of Europe,"I can't believe how underrated this game is! The tutorial mission isn't that difficult (the only problem is than they didn't mention you also need the left, right, up, down keys to maneuver with the plane). You just need to press W + down and that's all you need to lift the plane.  W-S: Control speed A-D: Control direction UP-DOWN-LEFT-RIGHT: Control inclination (Left-Right inclination may turn the plane down. You can correct it by using DOWN key). E: Shoot bomb/missile (Change with Q) SPACE: Shoot bullets CTRL+SPACE or CTRL+E : Shoot special projectiles (if available - Seen over score, at the left) F1-7: Activate different kinds of view. G: Pull/hide plane wheels  Aaand that'd be all I guess.  SPOILERS  -Really loved the bomber plane mission, I was just shooting while a pilot was driving and suddenly he was shot and I had to drive the plane! It was a bit difficult since the plane was really slow (as it should be nonetheless). -I suffered a lot with the mission where you steal a reaction plane from the nazis, it wasn't specially difficult but it didn't have any checkpoint. So you could go back to the beginning of the mission quite easily. That made this mission even more difficult than the last ones.  I remembered it now. I didn't know I had to press G to pull the wheels out. Otherwise I couldn't land and I ended up exploding.  SPOILERS END  I played this game as a child and it's been a long time since then.

Lots of environmental interaction and an interesting open world. A few downsides: only 2 players max, the level editing and creation tools are buggy and hard to use.  Also, like MANY games, the inventory management and crafting system are clumsy and can become overwheming or annoying. Luckily, you don't have to craft to play the game, so it can be ignored. Even still, trying to sort though pages of icons to find the right magical arrow or ring with the +2 lockpicking that you need to open that chest can get very tedious.  I'd buy it again, and with upcoming updates planned, it looks like it will only get better.",1,0

241930,Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™,"There are so many things I love about this game and many great reviews so I will just list the things that I think reduce the end result.   - Difficulty Setting:  There is no real difficulty setting to choose, while the game can be difficult early on it quickly becomes a one sided fight and near the end you rarely if ever die. It would really have been nice to include the option to increase difficulty in a more major way than just turning off combat icons. Alongside increasing the health/damage of opponents there could have been a way to decrease xp/power earned, this would drag the game out a little longer for those after a challenge and leads into my next point.   - End-Game:  Once you approach the later sections you become very powerful and even a half competent player should die very rarely. While this is not an issue on its own, I do believe that the game  needs a New Game+  feature or an option to 'stunt' the players progress.   - Stats:  I like the way you can build the legend of your weapons.... what i find baffling is that you are unable to see the statistics on how many orcs you have killed with a paticular weapon?! It would be nice to know that my sword has taken the life of a thousand orcs!   Part of me wants to continue playing this game as the combat is so much fun, however there is only so many times you can salughter orcs for the sake of it.",1,0
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"I've been holding off on a review of The Division because this is a bit of a tricky one to tackle. We're going to take this in layers. From all the E3 reviews and trailers we were constantly shown amazing things. There was this vibrant online community because everyone played a hero in a sense and was about helping fellow agents. Flying drones and police vehicles being called in and used to assist players. And the graphics, the beauty of it all, rendered crystal clear and spot on to reality.   From that, layer one made it to release. The game is spectacularly beautiful. Having been to New York myself and even specifically spent a few weeks in the area of Manhattan, it is simply mind blowing to see it brought to life in such clarity and detail as Ubisoft presents, with weather effects, lighting, everything spot on.  Layer two, we peel away those beautiful graphics. We're left with the base game itself and it's gameplay. There's nothing too amazing here though. Under that makeup there's a basic cover shooter with some multiplayer mechnics which is fairly solid, nothing new, certainly not the rpg that was advertised. From the perspective of someone who plays rpgs, there's not even the slightest illusion of choice, character customization is an HR person's wet dream in terms of multiculturalism but offers little variety or customization, regardless of what gun I pick up or what stats it has it's still going to do about the same thing, shoot the same bad guys with the same bullets.   Finally we have layer three, the heart of the game, the story. No spoilers here. The game is based on the idea that you are an everyman hero. You picked up the banner of honor at your government's call for assistance without question. Signed is an exceutive order that you are free and above the law, you are now judge, jury, executioner. You are being sent to New York which despite having nearly the most infrastructure in the world in terms of handling emergencies as been taken down by cut government funding to healthcare resulting in a shortage of treatment for what is basically the flu. Not some super flu that makes your eyeballs pop, just normal illness. The one people would rather you stay at home from work but you show up anyway because your boss gets fussy when you call out and now everyone on your floor has it but they won't call out either.  And now we start to get into how stupid this story is. In the event of floor after floor of co-workers getting sick with the common flu they send in John McClaine, aka you, to start shooting people. Or rather you're there to shoot people who are struggling to get out. Are you poor? Without a home to go to? In such desperate need of a meal that you'd fight someone for a few scraps of a snack bar? Boom, get mowed down.   How many of the Rikers, the bad guys you go full tilt murder spreed on, are innocent people held without bail while a hearing can be arranged. There's a famous story in the news about a kid held there for four years. Four years of hard prison for nothing only to be finally released and swept under the rug. How about the people in for minor drug offenses? Cop found a baggie in your car and now you're one of the people being served up for the player's murder spree. That's just one group of people and usually there are more with causes that are just as justifiable as anything you are doing.  The game persents you, as a card carring murder tool of the government, and while the government wasn't spending money getting medical supplies and infrastrcuture to New York, that same goverment was building a secret police group and arming them to the teeth to trod on the people. Gee, where in history have I heard that story before? Yet somehow it's always GTA in the news, not this modern day nazi simulator. I don't tend to be too much of a social justice warrior and I love blasting through bad guys, but I eventually had to quit playing this game because of how sickening it made me feel murdering innocent people for loots and powerups.  So there you have it. Enjoy your purchase if you bought the game. Hopefully they'll eventually make good on that season pass I hear not doing anything with. Look you made it through a whole review without any mention of the Dark Zone. If you're a fan of the series I think you're either not a gamer or possibly a facist sociopath, but I'm not hating on you. You are the special snowflake you were meant to be.",-1,0

381210,Dead by Daylight,"Using that ye olde slasher film theme, Dead by Daylight provides an interesting challenge... but most of it for the wrong reasons, namely balance.  There is no logic or reason to matchmaking. You can have a level 1 killer against a party of 4 level 30+ people. If this were a game purely based on skill, this would be fine. However, there are too many elements that favor survivors over killers that it's blatantly unfair. You can only kill surivors via hooking them, but survivors can destroy all the hooks except 4 that are all together, meaning if you down someone far away enough, they can simply run from you. There are spots where they can consistently outpace you, leading to Scooby-Doo moments. Even if you corner a survivor with full against a window or hatch, you can do nothing to them, because if you strike them, they can climb through while you're busy enduring a long cooldown animation and unable to run or interact with anything.  Survivors need to repair generators in order to escape. When they complete a generator, there's a ping that alerts the killer to said generator... except there's nothing that stops players from fixing 99% of generators and then start flicking them all on in succession.  But to top it all off, it's how you gain 'exp' and what you spend it on that makes the game brutal, with plenty of points favoring survivors. To gain bloodpoints, you have to do a myriad of things, such as chasing/running, destroying things, surviving/assisting, and so forth. Against a leveed or coordinated team, the killer is at a severe disadvantage and stands to gain very little in comparison to survivors. And apparently the devs just give killers the middle finger and make it harder for them to actually participate in a more balanced game.",-1,1

It's so intense no-scoping dudes in bushes and shooting them in the p3nis with the M9. The atmosphere is astounding and you will feel like a challenged sniper, a mentally challenged one. I do recommend it because it is fun so far. You shoot someone in the face and the guy next to him runs like 15 feet away and stops thinking 'Dat snoipa will neva get me!' And be aware, spacebar will take a screenshot no matter which key you use for it usually. It's free on IndieGala so you can give it a shot with a few friends and laugh.

441920,Dovetail Games Flight School,"Okay, this is coming from a person who has spent years on FSX/P3D since original release. It took less than one flight for me to decide that this 'sim' was outright awful, from all the freezes, black screens (you can hardly even use fullscreen). The sim was DELAYED an ENTIRE MONTH so they could 'polish the game.' This was honestly just baiting so that more people would pre-order to get the twin-star early, then they push it back. Before then, NEXT TO NOTHING was published of actual in-game footage and no-one knew what they were actually pre-ordering. Looks to me like DTG just played their customers for more money because they knew that this wasn't going to be even close to decent. You CAN NOT re-map your controller axis like you could before. The options menu is an extreme pain to use. Graphics in the sim are pretty bad and do not look good. Aircraft have extremely limited functionality. It is even LESS playable than the original FSX released in 2006.  All around it is a dog to use and I feel properly ripped off for my $15. It is maybe worth $5, if that. The fact it is advertised as an 'intro' sim is pathetic. All this product will do is push new flight simmers away from the market because it is so bad.   Dovetail had a lot potential with a re-do of FSX. But they completely dogged it up. I would say DO NOT buy this sim, it is a complete waste of money, and I will be receiving a refund for my copy. If anyone is new and are considering buying this, just go get P3D or FSX:SE or even the old boxed version. You will much prefer it over what DTG are doing here.  After this, I have extremely diminshed expectations for what the full sim will be like, and I thoroughly believe that DTG are just trying to make a quick buck.",-1,1

356090,Machineers,"The introductory episode of Machineers is awfully short. 72 minutes to complete in a very leisurely fashion. I was really expecting twice as much content, even for $5.  There is a small amount of replayability or non-puzzle interaction. For example, once you (partially) fix a Space Invaders game, you can play it. Once you fix a DJ console, you can mix a track. And if you choose not to complete the 1st episode by traveling to River City, you can take a vehicle to the race track to compete against the clock. One lap takes about one minute; the best players do it in 49 seconds. This replay value isn't much, but it's more than most pure puzzle games give you.  If you are looking for a very short, very casual puzzle game, Machineers would be a good choice. Kid friendly for mechanically-oriented kids. But I can't recommend it as good value for $5.",-1,0

212480,Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed Collection,"This game deserve a few minutes of reviewing. First of all I'm not a big console fan and I prefer simulation racing game to arcade ones. I enjoyed Mario Kart on the SNES back in the days but the further iterations were just 'meh' to me because I haven't felt any great improvement over the years. I bought this kart racing game on sale to increase my Steam library and to have a casual game to play with some friends online. I'd never tough I'd get hooked like this. It actually beats Mario Kart in every aspect thanks to it's diversity, freshness and style. The artwork quality is outstanding compared to other arcade PC games and I run at a constant 60fps on a low-midrange card with everything maxed out; it's that well optimized. The gameplay is fast, responsive and the tracks are very diversified. The levels are all themes of different Sega games in history from Sega Master System up to Dreamcast along with some brilliant remastered music. The world tour mode will encourage you in many different competition to unlock every characters and the multiplayer online, or offline up to 4, will keep you playing this little arcade gem for a while.. and come back to it from time to time because there is nothing else like it on PC. If you see this on sale, you have no excuses to overlook it. Thank you Sumo Digital &amp; Sega for the best arcade game I played until now",1,1

108710,Alan Wake,"Alan Wake is a very atmospheric game with elements that I like alot... and then again the game has elements that I dislike a lot. The thing that makes this game is the story - everything between the beginning and the end is worth it for the story.  The most frustrating thing in this game is that you are basically forced to run through it since the shadow enemies keep respawning and respawning. And all I wanted to do is explore the beautiful setting! That's usually a game killer for me - endlessly teleporting enemies - but with this exact game a lot can be forgiven just for the story. And to be fair there are also sections where the enemies do not spawn into existence eternally - once you kill all of them you can explore safely but unfortunately this is not always the case - and it hurts this game a lot.  If you're into exploration then this might not be the ideal choice for a game since even if you ever manage to find a hidden cache somewhere you are punished immediately with a band of shadow enemies who basically steal your loot because you end up using your newly found ammo on them. Towards the end the combat gets really tiring, the same pattern keeps repeating with predictable enemy 'ambushes'. Regarding the story the last chapter could have been cut short removing some uninspiring combat sections and forwarding the story instead.  With all that said the game is still good. The story manages to turn a gameplay-wise mediocre game into a masterpiece. I also enjoyed the little things a lot - the radio shows, TV shows and posters with some recognizable references. Personally I don't wish to see more of Alan Wake, I hope that after Quantum Break Remedy moves on to something else entirely - but that's just me. I know there are some hardcore Alan Wake fans out there dying to see more of it.",1,0

384550,Painters Guild,"Painter's Guild is a simplified take on the management genre, wherein you micromanage painters to fulfill orders, mix up paint and sleep. You start with just one painter, and have the opportunity to expand your studio in order to hire new painters and buy more furniture that will help your painters out. That said, you don't have much of a primary goal in this game outside of buying the best furniture or simply expanding your studio until you grow bored of it, which is a shame because it grows samey and tiresome within a few hours.  Painter's Guild is a fun, little game but I would not recommend buying it full price, simply because you likely won't get much time out of it. Definitely worth a shot on sale!",1,0

337000,Deus Ex: Mankind Divided™,"It's finally here! The newest installment of the Deus Ex franchise is a lot of fun. The gameplay is fun and pretty well done, there's a lot of exploration to be done and secrets to be found. The game feels a lot less linear than Human Revolution, and so far the story is well told. Gone are the clunky boss fights that ruined HR, playing a pacifist playthrough is very fun and finding a shortcut or alternate path to an objective feels very rewarding.  Graphics wise, the game looks like a more polished version of its predecessor. Some people are reporting significant graphical issues, however I have been pretty lucky and have had no trouble running the game on ultra (GTX980). Your mileage may vary.   However, none of this matters because Square Enix has absolutely ruined the game with their disgusting microtransactions. As you have no doubt heard by now, SE has included microtransactions not just for multiplayer, but for ammunition, grenades and praxis kits (used to unlock abilities) for SINGLE PLAYER. The fact that somebody approved this sheer idiocy to be part of the game is a staggering condemnation not just of Square Enix, but the modern video game industry as a whole.   DE:MD could have been such a good game. Unfortunately, it now exists solely as a beacon highlighting the utter contempt we as gamers are held in by Square Enix.   Shame, shame, shame.   EDIT: Yeah yeah yeah, someone wrote some words you disagree with on the internet and you're mad and decide to get personal about it because you can't express yourself properly, I get it. Sorry about your anger management and possible Aspergers, but props to you for trying. Yes, the microtransactions are optional, but it's the implication for the future of the industry that I really despise. If SE makes an absolute truckload of $$$ from this- and there's no doubt in my mind that they will, thanks to people like you guys who will evidently lap up any steaming turd slapped down in front of you while getting butt apocalyptically furious at anyone who dares to say that it wasn't that tasty- EVERY game for the next 10 years is going to include this rubbish Once that happens, how long do you think before these companies start doing stuff like, I don't know, reducing xp rates or ammo drops to give you gentle pushes towards the store? Sure you can play without ever using the store, but wouldn't life be easier if you had a few gas grenades right now? For just 2 clicks of the mouse and $5, you can! That's the future we're heading towards, and the single player microtransaction store in this game has advanced us about 9/10ths of the way down the road.  That such a major company would be so balls-out and open about trying to milk their customers out of every single spare dollar is a pretty big deal, and it's absolutely appalling. Mobile games have been doing this crap (and being DESTROYED for it) for years- why is everyone suddenly OK with it now that it's happening to us on PC/Console?  Is the game good? Yeah, it is. But I couldn't ever recommend anyone else buy this as it stands currently.",-1,1

You will be on the edge of your seat as you battle the bosses. And if you're into building and collecting (why would you buy Terraria if you weren't?!) then there's practically no end to this game.  The art style is perfectly charming and at the same time menacing when it comes to mobs and bosses. (something I must say Starbround has a problem with where mobs and bosses are concerned).

I initially decided to purchase this because it is a narrative-centric game that is well received. I knew little about it beforehand and was thus ambivalent when starting the game for the first time. It opened in a scene with beautiful music and immediately made me feel like I was in for a treat.  The game grabbed me and never let go.,1,0

Therefore I find Far Cry 3 to be a very pleasant surprise; A game that I don't think many people will find much at all to complain about.

327410,A Bird Story,"A simple story about a boy who saves and befriends and injured bird, or is it much more than that? Games like A Bird Story don't need words.

Nigh-un-paralelled in it's surreal narrative and world design, A Bird Story oozes with charm and character, from the profound music to the simplistic yet fitting art style. The game is rife with metaphors and symbolism, that of the likes I really encourage you to interpret yourself, rather than me offer any of my inane (or even insane) ramblings.  Freebird games have impressively used their limited tools and resources to finely weave a truly meaningful and unforgettable experience.

224060,Deadpool,"Being honest with you, I had never gotten into Deadpool before this game, and I didn't know anything about the Deadpool Universe so my review is just what I thought of the game in general. Deadpool is a really funny game and the game is basically about a scripted video game that Deadpool decides not to read and he rips the script up, so you basically dont know what happenes until it happenes obviously. Deadpool has alot of funny one liners and he has a special healing ability that I am pretty sure all Deadpool fans know about and you can upgrade all his weapons and of course himself. Nolan North voices Deadpool in the game and is fantastic but like I said I dont know what Deadpool normally sounds like.  The game Itself runs very well and is capped at 60FPS!, I was using DSR from 4K to 1080P with all the settings maxed out and the game runs extremely well, even the controls are actually quite good but you can adjust them if you want to.  Overall I enjoyed Deadpool, It is very funny at times, has easy achievements and the game runs like a boss, the combat can be repetitive at times but Deadpool's conversations during thoses time just make it feel new and fresh again. I would recommend this game to anyone even if you haven't gotten into Deadpool because thanks to this game I am interested in the Deadpool Universe now.",1,0

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"Man, I don't normally do reviews. I feel obligated to for this game, though. As a diehard MGS fan, this game (so far) has exceeded my expectations in almost every way. The gameplay is super smooth, the game runs like butter even with everything maxed, and so far I have experienced only one bug (the controls would switch back to default keybinds, after closing/reopening the game), which was fixed within a day or so of release.  I've sunk about 50 hours into it so far, and doing all the side missions between story missions, so I don't tear right through it. The AI is better than ever - it makes it super challenging and also a lot more fun, in that they adapt to how you usually encounter them. If you headshot a lot, they start wearing helmets. If you use smoke grenades, they start using gas masks. If you always sneak in at night, they start using flashlights. Definitely keeps you on your toes, and either sets you up with a bigger challenge each mission, or pushes you to try totally different tactics.  I've been loving the story so far, but I've gotta say - the one and ONLY thing that kind of lets me down, is the stark lack of cinematics in this game. I know previous games caught flak for it by a lot of filthy casuals not worthy of Kojima's genius, but I felt they really set this series of games apart. So far there have been a few, relatively short cinematics, but for the most part outside of missions, you're reliant on tapes to keep up with the story, or get into the nitty gritty of what's going on behind the scenes. They're great, and you can still understand the story just fine, but it's just not the same. Still would give the game a 9.5/10 so far - lack of long, Kojima-esque cutscenes aside, the game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazeballs.",1,0

The other problem is that most items require real money to unlock. All I'm saying is that if you want different weapons and don't want to spend any real money, then get ready to grind. 3/5 stars",1,0

218230,PlanetSide 2,"Back when Planetside 2 first came out, it was a damn mess. Servers were laggy, the certification system was counter-intuitive, and the game was so hilariously unoptimized that you needed a NASA super computer to run it at medium settings. I attempted in vain to play, and ended up rage-quitting.  Fast forward to late 2013, and a friend let me know that a massive optimization patch had been released. He thought it might be worth a try again. I'm glad I gave it another chance.  Planetside in its current state is a great game. Framerates have been improved, gameplay elements have been balanced, and the whole game feels tighter. Even on my now-aging-but-capable machine, I can get 30fps on medium in large battles. And the battles in PS2 are HUGE. They are easily the biggest I've ever seen, and it's a huge rush to be part of a team of 200 people pushing an enemy base.  If you do play PS2 (which is F2P), find yourself an Outfit ASAP. This is not a game that is meant to be played alone. Play with some friends and you'll have an amazing time.

311730,Dead or Alive 5 Last Round,"Little time put into at the time of writing. Played around for a bit to get a feel for the differences from the console versions and to see how the controller support is. Was rather wary of the 'partial controller support' they said on the store page. After some initial hiccups everything worked out fine. When starting the game, have your controller plugged in and use the controller to press A to continue, I was stuck with keyboard being assigned player one for the first time.  I've put in a plenty of hours since DOA 3 and in my opinion DOA 5 LR is the best in the series when it comes to the gameplay. I'm not a fan of the LR introduced new characters because they both feel very lazy. Rig and Mila were great, why the sudden drop in quality?  This particular game series is ridiculously controversial over the stupidest ♥♥♥♥ but is a very enjoyable fighting game. Massive bonus points for the inclusion of guests from Virtua Fighter who feel and play great and fit right in. More of this, please.   As it is now, I'm putting a positive hopeful review and shall check the online versus when it's introduced. I'd really wish they'd introduce more new characters and maybe even more VF guest characters in future updates and also hope they keep updating all the versions and not leaving the PC or old generation behind.   Some positives and negatives.  + AA + Hairstyles and easier customisation menu, said features displaying on character before confirming ++ Christie  + More than 400 costumes..

Personally all the side missions and extra stuff didn't have enough incentive, I think they could have designed things so you felt a little more compelled to use different equipment, improve the home and do the other side missions, the game would have felt more enriched in terms of gameplay then. The ship battles were the best part of the game aside the level design, and so it's no wonder that became the core part for AC4.

220780,Thomas Was Alone,"Thomas Was Alone is a game that has you control a band of suddenly sentient AIs roaming around the computer world stacking, jumping in portals and looking for an exit of their quadrate prison. Originally conceived during a personal 24-hour gamejam by Mike Bithell in 2010, the game, of course, has undergone much polishing and has definitely been deepened as an experience. The finished product is not only a simple platforming game in which you have to use different characters to progress through the level but also an interesting experiment in storytelling and, for the most part, characterization.  As you would expect, the core of Thomas Was Alone is jumping and using the right character for the right job, which the game handles in a very standard manner. The Blocks (characters) are of different width and height and also sometimes possess specific abilities – one can float on water, another acts as a trampoline – which is all what you would expect from a single-player puzzler. When you are given the right combination of unique characters the game truly shines. Combining the abilities of the anti-gravity James with the double-jump Sarah is immensely fun and, while the levels are rather easy, it is still very satisfying to see this small ensemble prevail. Sadly, most of the time, and especially in the levels that use a large amount of characters, the cooperation feels like a chore as many of the obstacles put before you are of a very artificial nature.   Thomas, the main character of the game, is an all-rounder and it feels like you could finish most of the levels using just him but the game imposes you with other characters that sometimes serve only as stepping stones once or twice, only to be left waiting for the player to finally switch to them and perform the menial task of controlling their useless, hard-edged bodies to the teleport. Most of the other puzzler games have the main character utilize tools, levers or switches to get to the end of the level, which then serve no other purpose. In Thomas Was Alone the tools are the characters and it simply does not work well. I assume the developer wants us to care about the characters, something that would create a natural drive to get them to safety, but the style of characterization makes this impossible.  Before I explain what exactly is wrong with the characterization and effectively flaws the whole design, I have to mention the base that drives the narrative in Thomas Was Alone – the narrator. The game, as many others after the success of Bastion, employs an all-knowing entity that outlines what is happening throughout the 5-hour journey. There are no visual cues, no gameplay mechanics that would serve to push the narration forward, so we have to rely on the voice of the British comedian Danny Wallace (who also helped with the script) and, as much as I loathe the idea of a narrator in a video game, he does that quite well, effectively adding to the overall soothing mood of the game. In the end though, one has to wonder if the inclusion of an external voice was, in fact, necessary. Would it not be better to make the narrator be the voice of Thomas, the main hero of the game, thus fleshing him out into a full character instead of the shell that he is now? Instead, the narrator provides us with bits and pieces of characterization for every AI we encounter, making the overall narrative heavily lean onto “telling” instead of “showing”. This makes the whole design fall flat as, in result, we do not really care about any of the controllable Blocks as they are not correctly shaped into characters. The narrator might tell you that X is feeling morose/happy/excited/etc., which is fine and dandy, but when it does not have any effect on the game you are playing, it makes the information completely pointless. The best example would be (and I hope you will not regard this as a spoiler) the situation when we are told that one AI is in love with another and… that is all that happens. No new mechanics are introduced, the Blocks do not suddenly work together in perfect harmony nor do they change their normal behaviour. The information changes nothing. To give credit where credit is due – the characterization of James is perfect. He is introduced as a lonely soul, forever ridiculed for being different from the rest and this actually translates to the gameplay – he is the only one that can, and even has to, move upside down. Unfortunately, no other character, maybe with the exception of the late-game Sarah, is crafted so well, making the platforming aspect loose most of its appeal.  Thomas Was Alone is certainly an experiment in the field of narration. Have everything that Mike Bithel designed clicked, it might have been a unique experience marrying the retro nostalgia with charmingly quirky modern storytelling. Sadly, it falls short of its noble goal, ultimately ending in a product that would be best labeled “style over substance”.   http://www.gatheryourparty.com/articles/2013/02/07/thomas-was-alone-review/",-1,0

19930,The Settlers: Rise of an Empire Gold Edition,I keep coming back and replaying this game as a fun little building game. The missions are relaxing and you feel like you're actually building a community in each map. The people have personality and your heroes are (often) useful. Combat is simplistic but satisfying. The story is solid enough without being melodramatic. Runs solid as a rock. I also enjoy the map variety. It's a great game!,1,0
302380,Floating Point,"It's a quite relaxing game, the mechanics are simple. Aim and click, you'll be attached to a platform where you can then swing with momentum, hold the click and it will retract you adding to your speed. Right click disconnects you from the platform, that's about it.  The swinging feels natural and the soundtrack is amazing, the options are alright before you start the game. In game however there are quite a few options to change how the game reacts, even reversing the  point  mechanics of the game, to where hitting objects raises the bars.   Speaking about the.. mechanics of the game, your... how to say, objective is to swing into the red bars and score points. The higher the bar the more points, you don't have to hit all of the bars to move on to the next level however hitting all of them shows your path.. which can be interesting.  The point of this game isn't stated or even implied, I use it to relax and have fun swinging point to point listing to the music, it helps calm me and at times when I get up great speed even excite me.

306130,The Elder Scrolls Online,"This is exactly what I expected, an MMO with a little RPG set in the Elder Scrolls world and I'm enjoying every minute. I'm a Bethesda fanboy and even I was concerned before buying this as I wasn't sure about the Beta but I got the full game and have never looked back.  My tempered thoughts are:   The lore could be more in depth but it works for an MMO, I like it but with the previous RPG's had TONS.   Without DLC it's tricky finding challenging zones to level up when you get to certain Veteran ranks even once you've completed the game in one faction map but I'm still playing.   I woud've liked greater choice and variation in the skills available. I like it but I think I've been spoilt by longer running MMO's like Guild Wars I/II and WoW.   I'm not sure I like the limitations on trading, you have to be with a trading guild, and can only list limited number of items. Again I've been spoilt by other MMO's.  It's not Morrowing, it's not Oblivion, it's not Skyrim, it's a straight forward MMO, (and NEW, so it's still growing) that balances the MMO and RPG elements well indeed.",1,0

281860,RefleX,"A fantastic top-down shooter. In RefleX your goal is to shoot down all the enemy ships while not being shot down yourself. You are aided by a shield, which reflects enemy bullets and shooting enemies down with reflected bullets awards double the points. Their is a catch though as the shield can only be used for a limited time before needing to be recharged and you cannot shoot while you are emitting your shield.  Reminincent of a certain  other  top down shooter, you spend a lot of time dodging very narrow gaps between enemy bullets and reflecting (homing) shots back at the enemy. Simple yet intuitive and a lot of fun! If you like top down shooters you will enjoy this.  The sound effects are sufficient and the music is great. If you aren't into bullet hell games but enjoy shooting things and making explosions then this game is for you (as well as Broforce, I suppose).

248390,Craft The World,"This game is not ready for release.  Current issues:   * Co-op mode is not available from the start. The game puts you into a lengthy tutorial mode and you won't play with your friends for hours, if ever, before you're done.  * UI tries to be user-friendly, with the ghost of dwarf fortress looming overhead. It's trying, it really is. And it fails, and fails hard. I could not figure out how to make a totem for over an hour before I realized that I cannot make one in the tutorial, it just gives you one. The UI for crafting is similar to minecraft misleading you to believe you have to guess the right combination to unlock it. You can't.  * Path finding is path failing. A lot. You'll be scratching your head why your guys won't place a bed or a torch or a ladder, or anything, even on flat terrain. It will fail with no explanation, over and over.  * To make a valid shelter you need to hit the wiki. You won't figure it out on your own. Without a valid shelter, your dwarves won't sleep in beds you make for them. By the time you get frustrated enough to hit the wiki you may realize that you've ♥♥♥♥ed up so hard you can never make a valid shelter and have to start over the whole thing.  I can go on, but I stopped here and so should you.  In closing, I applaud the developer for trying to make a user-friendly dwarf fortress, but there is a lot more work to be done here before this can be considered a user-friendly game.",-1,1

You can craft and combine many many weapon parts to create a weapon you like. Sadly you can carry only one gun at a time which makes the whole thing less interesting.   As far as a missions are concerted you will be coming back to the same maps over and over again (same layout, same enemies) and complete different objectives.

388880,Oxenfree,"Me: trying to get wife interested in gaming forever Me: hey, check out Oxenfree She: will not hand back controller for several hours She: 'I'm going to play Alex as a snarky teenage version of myself'  10/10 would engage in couples bonding exercise again   *** UPDATE ***  Finished the first playthrough.  1. Gameplay is based around dialogue. However, instead of having unlimited time to agonize over dialogue options, conversations happen in real time. No 5-minute pause while you watch your Commander Shepard stare off into space, occasionally twitching. If you dither, the moment passes, and so do those specific dialogue options.  2. This means that what you choose to say is always a snap, gut decision. And you'll start surprising yourself.  3. It also means that dialogue has a very organic rhythm. This gives the entire game a more natural flow, allowing you to fall into the story. It also makes the game quite fun to watch. (See above: wife not relinquishing controller.)  4. Writing and voice acting are superb.  5. In most dialogue-tree games, you have the sense that each 'conversation' is its own encapsulated mini-game with 2 or 3 possible outcomes (did you convince character A to make decision X?). In Oxenfree, conversations do not always occur in tidy chunks, and *everything* you say potentially matters. This, combined with those real-time gut decisions, make for a very different gameplay experience. It's absorbing.  6. The art is gorgeous.  7. The soundtrack is great.  8. Can't remember when I've been scared to just *walk a few pixels to the left, right over there* in a 2D side scroller, but story has its genuinely spooky moments. I wouldn't call it horror, but it's an excellent ghost story.  I adore Oxenfree and recommend it to anyone who has a human soul. Can't wait to see what Night Studio does next.",1,0

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"Don't buy this game unless you've got friends to play. Ubisoft is wholesomely cancerous, forcing you to install Uplay with this. The matchmaking has no rhyme or reason, pitting a team with an average level of 30 against 100. Experience with the game and its layout is, incidentally, extremely crucial to know in PvP. Players will kick you for not being leveled in the hundreds on casual and easiest difficulty, without said PvP. Estimated wait times are complete bull. There's no way to block people from repeatedly entering your sessions or report them for constantly team killing, which is unfortunate because unless it's a private game, you MUST have 5 people before you're allowed to hop in the level; 10 if you're doing PvP.   Even though you might gun for a public game, one player will be designated as the host, and if they leave, the entire sesssion is canceled and everyone is kicked back to the main menu, forcing you to sit and wait to hopefully find a session to join. There is also one level in the game that will send you back to searching for a session to join after completion, leading to scenarios where you wait 5 minutes to play a 2 minute match where everyone dies because said level obscures your sight while the A.I. can see through it with perfect ease, leading you to wait an additional minute just so you can try it again.  A small handful of characters are effectively stashed behind a paywall unless you religiously play this game and win hundreds of rounds to collect enough in-game points to unlock them. This would be less of a gripe if characters weren't placed on a first come, first serve basis, with half the roster being restricted to attacking and defending teams. Some guns are character exclusive as well, with some unable to change their primary and/or secondary at all, leading to little customization.  Recently, it feels there's been a patch, although it seems like it's just been nerfs all around. Apparently a shotgun won't kill an enemy AI at point-blank range, the walking suicide bombers soak up an entire machine gun's worth of ammunition and still run at you, and apparently even if you have a shield, an enemy can decide to knife it directly and one-shot you completely, because that's how physics work.  Sometimes there are good games with good people, but you'd best be prepared to do a lot of waiting and enduring nonsense for those few gems.",-1,1

216150,MapleStory,"First of all I don't have 9 hours on this game. I have a few thousand on this game. I just played the client version most of the time. Honestly, when this game came out way back when in '05, I played the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. It was hella fun but it was also really hard. I mean if you were level 50 you had great respect. Now getting to level 50 can be done in 2 hours as apposed to 2 months of training 4 hours a day. I mean like if you got to lv200 back then people would waste money to acknowledge you for what you have done. Now if you get to level 200 its just a race to 250 or to get super high damage and solo bosses to make real money on paypal or some ♥♥♥♥. Then later on they made Big Bang which made it super easy. Big Bang continues on and now its hard again. They raise the level cap from 200-250. Still takes like 3-5 days to get to Lv250 is unknown how long it will take because no one has reached there yet. In my opinion, this game has become completely pay to win. Nexon has declined in their service from where they started. Before buying NX was for like for clothes that didn't do jack ♥♥♥♥. But then nexon was all like, 'Lets make every piece of equipment ♥♥♥♥, and put a bunch of NX items to scroll them, reset their potenial, protect them from being destroyed and a bunch of other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.' That really made me mad and now I ended up spending more then $7000 on this game. I ended up making Close to $10,000 in paypal credit over time but that was only because I played way too much. I farmed bosses and scrolled and sold items all day and all night. I got sucked in and do me a favor, never get sucked in. I was lucky to make that much money back. To be honest, that was over the course of 4 years. Its not worth giving up even a minimum wage job for that kind of pay. Go get a job and make something out of your life. Back when there was only 4 jobs and it was super hard, those were the good days. Like the actually unbanned hackers recently just to get more attention back in the game. Wait i'm sorry, let me say that again. THEY UNBANNED HACKERS SO THEY COULD GET MORE PEOPLE TO PLAY THEIR ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GAME. I hate to say shiity but thats what it has become. Probably 70% of the userbase how is Hackers/Botters. Freaking Angel Prossecer is free and theres also BT that just allow people to level up fast and ♥♥♥♥. For christ sake the 3rd best highest level is a hacker. ZeroByDivide better known as Divide By Zero on Gamersoul (maplestory hacking website). He has some of the rares duped items and IGN's and so much more ♥♥♥♥. He has CLB's that hes always using to find exploits and hes also leveling super fast. This game is just not worth it any more.

They often have insanely small areas of effect. The result is that this is a game that is trying to be a mash-up of a shooter and turret defense game, yet fails at each. The 'classes' also are insufficiently differentiated. There's a little humor injected with some random sayings, and the 50s atmosphere is there...although it's not as strong as I wish it was.

238430,Contagion,"*Almost* the Zombie game we have all been waiting for   I have played a lot of zombie FPS (They Hunger, Zombie Master, Zombie Panic, NMRIH, L4D...ect), however I have longed for a game that captured the essence of a George A Romero zombie flick. At last we have a game where the zombies can only be dispatched by shooting them in the head! I am suprised this has not been done before, as it not only says true to the greatest zombie triology of all time, but more importantly, it rewards player accuracy.   The game offers a fantastic atmosphere, good gun mechanics and some interesting maps. What stands out from this game is the fantastic 'hunted' mode, which is essentially a last man standing PVP deathmatch with NPC zombies. However, it has a slight twist, in that when a player dies, they come back playing as a zombie. I loved the PVP element of 'Day Z', so this game mode was perfect for me. At present, I would even go as far as saying that the battles on this game are better, because the game mechanics are so fluid and the zombies are actually a threat.  Contagion is by no means perfect though, for starters, the objective game modes are hit and miss. Although the player is told what to do by a mobile phone, it is often not clear what the objective actually is, or where the player should go. The game is crying out for more maps, which I am sure will come when/if it gets workshop support. Also, I am hoping that the developers adapt the current barracading system, so that players can actually move objects (at present you can only place wooden boards).    Overall, this is a decent addition to the genre. Perhaps the amount of content does not justify the full price tag, but it is definitely worth picking up in the sale for the 'hunted' gameplay mode. Hopefully it will develop and maintain a healthy player count.   7.5/10",1,0

I've played both this game and its sequel (Metro: Last Light), and this one's much better than the sequel is, although that's not a slight to Metro: Last Light because that's also a good game. You can stealth (which is preferred by me) or go guns blazing, but you have to keep an eye on your ammo because it runs out quickly and you can't always find adequate sources in the game (depending on the difficulty level). Definitely worth buying.",1,0

It has around I'd say like 30-100 hours on it, depending how much u actually enjoy this type of game. I would have played a whole lot more on it (Even after beating it) but, my PC is shizzzz.

6860,Hitman: Blood Money,"I. Love. Hitman. Ever since I got my hands on Hitman 2: Silent Assassin I've been a fan of this game. Now IO Interactive and Eidos have seriously improved the series and Blood Money is the best in terms of the many different ways you can complete a mission. It's just pure, raw, stealth. You have DOZENS of ways to kill your targets in inventive or... very blunt ways :P  Visually. It's great. Storyline? It's all in retrospect about what 47 has been up to as some people are looking for him. Jesper Kyd creates another sinister soundtrack that mixes well with the gameplay and all in all, this game. Is. Amazing. The addition of the 'notoriety' system means that if you make too much noise or gain too much attention, people will slowly recognise you in later missions if you don't bribe officials. It's awesome. But if your a 'Silent Assassin', you can save your cash for super upgrades for your already crazy Hitman arsenal :) Buy this game. Hitman Absolutions is next so try this game out now!",1,0
252950,Rocket League,"I know that this review will get a lot of dislikes,because of Rocket League fan boys,but I dont mind. The game looks pretty fun.Football and cars,what can you want more? First I was really happy,and game was looking awesome for first 20 hours.After that I saw 'Glorious Matchmaking'. Ranking system is so broken.After 4 wins cant even get division up?Lost 1,division down.Great logic. Second thing about matchmaking is,if you play for example 2x2,1 guy is Prospect 2 rank,other one is Challanger 3,they will get opponent around Prospect 3-4 rank.So thats not even fair from opponent side.CS GO had same terrible ranking system,but after some years they managed to fix it.Rocket league MUST fix it,because its really frustrating from personal experience.Or if you want to get all achievements you must buy DLC,thats another bad thing from customer point of view. And third thing,community is really terrible.Just like in Dota 2 or CS.Sometimes I regret,that i bought this game. Game isnt bad,but it needs some fixes.If you have friends to play,go get it.But until developers wont fix Matchmaking system,I couldnt recommend this game for others. Thanks for reading! :)",-1,1

With LA Noire, it just might, finally, have found the embodiment of that particular holy grail.From start to finish, LA Noire feels like a film – LA Confidential, in fact, along with any similarly hard-boiled example of film noir adapted from stories by the likes of Chandler and Hammett.

50130,Mafia II (Classic),"This game has so many split opinions, from a outsiders point of view, it must be quite hard to decide whether or not to give this game a go; my advice; try it! This will either be a game you will love or hate. It's not a GTA clone nor is it a sandbox game; it is a linear game with a cracking story with a wonderful city to explore and have fun in.  Mafia 2 for me is a gem; I still have it installed from day 1 and still play it on a regular basis; in fact I would say this is the most replayed game that I own and I own a fair few to say the least. The game itself has a great atmosphere which needs to be soaked in to get the most out of it; rush through this game and you will lose the majority it. With a superb orchestral and radio tracklisting adding to the atmosphere of Empire Bay which itself is a beauty to behold.  If you love the main game there are 3 dlc's which are well worth a punt. The Betrayal of Jimmy/Jimmy's vendetta and Joe's Adventures; the last being the best of the three.",1,0

311340,METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES,"First of all if you're just looking for a linear story experience then buy something else, this is not the cutscene heavy go from point a to point b typical metal gear game.  If you can get over that and actually adapt to the new gameplay style you will vastly enjoy this game and get more than your money's worth. This is a game about exploration and experimentation. There is one main mission and six side missions, two of which are unlockable. If you just go through the missions just to beat them you'll probably get 4-5 hours of content, possibly more depending on how long it takes you to tackle those missions.   The real meat of the game is experimenting with the new fox engine and how to tackle those missions. For example there is a side mission where you have to assassinate two targets, now you can just go and kill them, you can go and grab a sniper rifle and take them out from a distance to more easily escape, you can extract both of the targets by chopper to get more information, it's up to you.  There's also prisoners and hidden secrets in every mission and context sensitive events that can be uncovered and triggered. All of these hidden secrets are the main story of this game. If you want to understand why certain characters act a certain way during the main game or what happened before you got there you have to uncover the tapes, they also potentially reveal information about The Phantom Pain. There's also XOF patches to find to unlock the two extra missions as well as unlockable weapons that can be placed at the starting point of each mission.  The gameplay is amazing in this game, with the addition of open world gameplay you have no radar so you have to mark and pay attention to enemies, there are such small details added that affect gameplay like the difference in knockout time between choking a guard, tranquilizing a guard and punching out a guard, how long a guard will stay asleep in a dark area versus a sunny area and other features. Reflex mode is an optional bullet time that triggers when you're spotted and it balances out the guard AI which can spot you from anywhere and from far distances especially on hard difficulty,  As a PC port of a console game this is one of the best PC ports I've ever played, there are so many customization options and it has been optimized perfectly and the controls are excellent with the exception of no mouse control in menus.  There is also a lot of mod support for this game and I have no doubt the modding community for this game will expand and produce more content in the future, this game is amazing and definitely worth the money if you can accept it as a new type of experience.",1,0

223830,Xenonauts,"It's a good investment. Especially if you are interested in games that could last for months before you complete it. Worth every penny spent.   Things to know before you buy: 1) Turn based strategy combat 2) Global UFO invasion, human planetary defense theme.  3) Many many items, research, craft, etc.. 4) Interesting, real time air-craft to UFO combat. Simple with option to skip, or surprisingly in depth when you care to google strategies. 5) Completely randomized maps, interesting destroyable environments, ... 6) Humans are punished with low vision, extreme weakness to overpowered psi attacks; which is only there because the Alien AI is wacky.  I'm only half way through the game currently. See you in another 40 hours when I conqure the Aliens, or when the Aliens conquer Earth.  It's now 3/24/2016, late update, I beat the game about a month ago. The game I played had practically zero game breaking bugs (Possibly fixed them before it got to me). I did need to restart once, because I didn't know research was that important. Even on easiest mode, you will be rushed to min/max your time used.

Game is beautiful, gameplay is fantastic.  They did change the controller scheme that we're use to from Asylum and City (I think Origin too). I don't understand the need for that, but whatever. It's batman, you're batman, and it's extremely entertaining. Voice acting is top notch.   This is my first pre-order...ever.

50300,Spec Ops: The Line,"Spec Ops: The Line is a hidden jem in my opinion. From the steam page, not much is known about the true nature of the game, although, I believe anyone who does play the game will be in for a beautiful but tragic ride. At first the game seems like a normal 3rd person shooter, a decent combat system and beautiful environment makes it almost seem like a battlefield game. But things quickly take a turn when your squad transitions from soldiers to survivors. You slowly realize this isn't just another army game, the things you and your men have to do to stay alive are terrible, and both you and the characters will question the meaning of their lives and choices. The walk to insanity is a slow one, and you and your men will suffer through it.The game is tragic, dark, saddening, and lonely. Mix that in with beautiful environment, graphics, and excellent voice acting, and you have a gripping, adrenaline pumping, and tear jerking experience. It defies the rules laid out by most games. There are no right choices, there is no redemption, and you will feel the regret and pain from the repercussions. Final summary: 8.5/10, a great experience for someone who wants a psychological and deeply emotional game.",1,0

235600,Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Blacklist,"'It's okay.'  Ubisoft's pattented clunky-control system aside, this is a good call back to the original set of splinter cell games, allowing sam to ♥♥♥♥ around with his old set of gadgets in some fresh new maps and an 'amazing' storyline. It feels slightly cliche, along the idea of Battlefield 3's campaign etc.  The 'new' voice actor for Sam delivers his lines with much gusto, as the motion-capture-and-face-recorded takes do marvelously to bring out Fisher's features. The voice acting is less Michael Ironside's tough guy act, more 'Big Boss' No-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t attitude.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlUnTcjlkd8   This game adds a 'unique' customisation system in the sense of Vegas' RPG style credit system, earn cash by doing specific tasks and spend it on new weapons, gadgets, suits and perks. If you hate this kind of stuff, you can always cheat (or be forced to cheat) by buying the deluxe edition, which adds nothing new to the game aside from unlocking some mid-tier weaponry and 'exclusive' mid tier gadgets/armour, which you unlock better equivalents of further through the game, anyway.  Basically, the game allows you to play in multiple styles, designated by 3 categories, Ghost, Panther and Assault. The more you play of one style, the more points you will gather, yet only Ghost gives you the optimal amount of payout to earn money for new EQ, slightly forcing your hand. Ghost style means mostly sneaking around hostiles and completing objectives without being spotted, and taking out hostiles non-lethally, while panther allows more freedom of movement with eliminating hostiles in a covert fashion. Assault means going out guns blazing, netting you the lowest amount of points and the hardest time in the game unless you're one of those meth-amped up CoD kids that really doesn't understand the basic principle of 'stealth video games'.  Each mission has a set few side objectives, those being: Neutralizing/capturing a specific enemy, collecting a hidden data drive and/or hacking into a random laptop. These objectives are always in the same spot in their respective maps, and not at all randomly generated, not leaving much surprise.  Speaking of random generation, although many youtubers mention that the AI seems to be 'almost completely random', they are not. Every time a mission is loaded, the AI will choose a specific preset which the AI will follow to the letter, every single time. The AI will only react randomly if they are engaged or distracted. This means it's an easy speed run game as every movement can be pretty much perfected with zero effort with this game's lenient stealth system.  I say lenient as I am one of the older SC series players, light had a much greater effect on stealth and there were several speeds to maneuver under, this game throws all of that out of the door for a simple 'dark' and 'light' system, where it shows you if the surrounding area is 'dark enough' to give you bonus stealth points (e.g., harder to see depending on your suit's stealth rating). The AI does not have a limited vision cone and WILL spot you halfway across the map hiding behind a box if it's bright and shiny out, yet being in the dark doesn't make you completely invisible either. Mostly only if you try to stay still, or move as fluently as possible will you be able to evade vision completely. Moving with not enough forethought will most likely get you spotted and killed.  Difficulty ranges from walking around like a big tank on easier modes, to being killed nearly immediately once spotted. Gear can be rigged to be combat oriented, allowing more ammunition capacity and total hits absorbed, or stealth oriented, making you incredibly fragile, but very versatile and hard to spot. It's possible to balance the two out as well, to go for the panther style and engage targets covertly and lethaly from various ranges, or evade sight.  The AI itself was, at the time, already outdated. Smart enough to be able to find cover, they will most likely rush your last known location guns blazing. Imagine this, when you walk out of sight, as in the previous few ♥♥♥♥♥♥ SC installments, a ghost pattern of your last known location is left behind. The enemy will actively fire at this position, supposedly to blanket covering fire for other units to flank your position. This works quite well in open terrain, but not so much in closed off corridors. Most levels are 'open' and less liniear (to today's cookie cutter shooter game standards, at least), however when there ARE closed off corridors, enemies will start to move up with each other in a straight conga-line, opening fire on your ghost while one by one passing through it, turning to face it and continuing to fire. At least the AI doesn't appear to have friendly fire, so that's great.  The AI chatter is a different thing, spoken in many languages, sometimes by just one/two voice actors per 'region'. Voice acting is of great quality. They'll switch to English if the player is within cognitive distance. I've not heard the same lines of dialogue, perhaps if one were to reload a level multiple times they will.  As said before, weapons can be customized, but aside from aesthetics and stat-wise, only the scopes and laser sight will truly affect gameplay, as they allow either easier shot acquisition or first person aiming, with a really glitchy broken laggy sensitivity scope, just like Ubisoft does best. Q&amp;A? What's that?  Unfortunately, there's also broken addon ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like a cellphone app that ubisoft dropped years ago and hasn't updated since, that lets you unlock mid-tier gear for the beginning of the game. As the app doesn't work, this is impossible to achieve. So yeah, no 100% completion for anyone. Because Ubisoft doesn't give a rats ♥♥♥ about you.  Multiplayer is back as usual, with a similair feel to it as Chaos theory had, lets all pretend like the previous 4(5?6?) SC's didn't happen. You can unlock new ♥♥♥♥ by getting tokens, I couldn't be arsed, there's probably some meta out there somewhere and I wouldn't be surprised if tokens are secretly some purchasable microtransaction in-game currency.   Unfortunately, the 'freedom of movement' of the first 3 splinter cells is vaguely present, half the obstacles that you would be able to climb in, for example, Chaos theory, cannot even be scaled in this one, often leaving you slamming face first into walls and obstacles in the middle of an enemy patrol. It's also no longer possible to jump (on/)off ledges, buildings etc.  The controls feel sticky sometimes, where pressing the climb button will send Sam flying off to a nearby ledge instead of over a fence you're trying to climb, of course halting progress to a dead drop and often causing me to get spotted. Adding to that is the sprint button's double functionality as a 'terrain cancelling' move, kind of like in Assassin's Creed's style freerunning, unfortunately this also automatically drops you off of ledges, so trying to climb ontop of something in a hurry is better done bashing the climb button rather than holding sprint, as it may send you sailing off of rooftops in a heartbeat. Not that you can actually kill yourself by falls in this game, as any sort of freedom is stripped away from you, only being able to climb up or off of ledges, pipes, scaffoldings, ladders etc. where the game deems fit. No more Chaos Theory style aerial knockdowns from the top of a rooftop, no sirree, players nowaday need to hands held at all times and can make no decisions for themselves.   That's all I can think of right now, I'd suggest getting this game if one of your friends has it just to enjoy the COOP, otherwise, wait for the next sale, if ever.",1,0

325610,Total War: ATTILA,"Well, it looks like they did try to make a good game this time. And it worked. It is a good game, though i still enjoy rome 1 and medieval 2 more. The map looks like the one from rome 2, but there have been improvements. They re-introdused the building-conversion, where you need to convert buildings to your own culture. The family tree is back, and you can now upgrate generals, armies, and agents.  The battles do have some little issues, like the one where i once lost my whole army because the instandly all fled away when my king died..... there is a lot of things wrong with the morale in this game. The towers in the towns are overpowered: they kill a lot of men, make sure you capture them quickly.  You can now loot and destroy cities. If you destroy the city, everything is gone. if that happens an other faction can settle in that region, if they have the money to do so. It is very expensive to rebuild a region.  there probebly is a lot more to tell, but after 15.3 hours this is what i think that is important to tell to everyone who maybe wants to buy this game: it's a good game if you like rome 2, if not it still isn't bad, but the older games are less expensive, so if this would be your first total war game, then go and buy rome 1 or medieval 2: the graphics are worse, but the game is better, and a lot more fun to play.  rating: 6.5/10 because it improved from rome 2, and already was a decent game at release date.",1,0
212680,FTL: Faster Than Light,"FTL is a great indie, rogue-like game that is wrapped in a hidious RNG system. It plays well, has insane amounts of replay value, and feels different each and every time you play it, but the game is based down to 99% luck, 0.9% Weapons Pre-Igniter, and 0.1% skill. Still, It's one of the hardest, yet greatest game I've ever played. The game has something for all masochistic gamers and sadly, it has consumed me as well. Think of it as 'Dark Souls' for the indie/star-fi world. That's pretty much an exact representation. Moving on to the price now. Yes, the price of $10 is well beyond reasonable. The game is so captivating, that it'll eventually will entirely consume you. So next time you have any extra money lying around and you think to yourself something stupid like, 'I'm going to put this in my savings account.', then remember this message and buy this game. 8/10.",1,0

349040,NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 4,"First ;3 (I was first at posting a review on this game, but now i'm updating it to actually be a review!)  So, a lot of people have been complaining about the 30 FPS lock, no V-sync, and FPS drops and the such, I have never really cared much about FPS, sure, i'd love to have 60 FPS or even more, but i still think this game is fun as it is, and i haven't had a single FPS drop so far!  Cons: -Most people complain about FPS drops. - 30 FPS lock - Controls on pc can be very confusing if you don't change them, and one of my fav sets of setups are not available, because of the non-existant rebind Lshift and L-CTRL. So you might want to get a controller.  Pros: -WALL FIGHTING IS BACK. -Really nice and fluid combat. -It's Naruto, if you like Naruto that's good i guess? -Graphics are really amazing, probably the best i've seen ever, just the colours man. -No fillers 10/10 -IGN -Nice in-game menu. -Story mode is really cool so far! -Full controller support, got one just for this game, and it runs like butter. :3    Overall, if you have a really good PC, you don't have to worry so much about the FPS drops and such, i haven't had a single problem so far. Also you want to have a controller if you can. lol i suck at rewiews",1,1

When I play this game and pray to the gods of the dice rolls for mercy on the next roll, I realize 1. there are no gods of dice rolls because if there were they would all be evil 2. you are really at the mercy of a random number generator that does not appear to be influenced by 'strategy' 3. the tutorial missions do nothing but slow down the pace of punishment to lull you into a false state of confidence 4. that if I were a truly sadistic artist and programmer that revelled in the smashed keyboards and gritted teeth of my victims, I would make this POS and upload it to Steam under the guise of a 'game'.

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"This game is a nice add-on to the all-loved Fallout 3, however I feel like it falls behind in a lot of ways. I'm gonna go over the 'cons' first. The first problem is with the general layout. In Fallout 3 everything was very spread out and it felt right being that way, kinda like a typical new-suburb kind of design. In New Vegas, everything is equally spread out, but once you get into the city it just feels wrong. The actual New Vegas strip is literally like 6 buildings in the game, and they are all tiny. The buildings feel like they are about the size of a large house, maybe a bit taller. In Vegas, these buildings are absolute behemouths, the original Caesar's Palace was built on a 34-acre site, for example. As a result, New Vegas feels lame compared to the real thing, and I think that while it's not realistic to actually compare it, they could have at least made it a little better.  The second issue I have with the game is pacing. The game runs on about a level per hour pace, which, while completely acceptable in most aspects, leaves a long time before you level up in the early levels, which can be frustrating. The quests start out fine, but the way they are billed is strange. Staying away from spoilers here, theres quests where you have to complete another quest inside the quest. The weapon/armor upgrading is hard to tell if it even exists. When I stopped playing I had 8k caps and couldn't find anything better than a rifle I got from a side quest 3 levels in. The game just feels off.   Lastly is the unexplained things. You gain reputation with certain groups but that's never explained, it just happens. You get quest markers inside things filled with enemies with no explaination ('oh, you have to go talk to this guy first.'). Also, there are multiple endings, but you never get told that. At one point I had 2 quests for 2 different endings in one area and while trying to do one, finished the other (it was just a 'talk to this guy' kind of thing). The unexplained things are just rediculous IMO, and without the wiki (which contains tons of spoilers) makes the game harder than it should be.   However, with all of this, it's still a Fallout game. If you're like me and you've played Fallout 3 to death it is still a decent game. Worth giving a shot and deciding for yourself.",1,0

There's the occasional puzzle and some exploration, but combat is not present and there isn't much of a challenge. In my opinion, this is to the game's credit. The game had me close to tears using the simple story of an old man holding on to one last regret. Absolutely fantastic.",1,0
381210,Dead by Daylight,"What can I say about this game really. It freaking terrifying as a survivor and brutal as a killer. The whole objective of the game is to turn on a number of generators and escape the map by opening one of two doors. The killer tries to stop you from doing said things and said things take quite a while to turn on or open plus if the killer catches you he'll either take you to the nearest hook or let you lay there and bleed out. Survivors are in 3rd person view while the killer is in first person. There are currently 5 killers at the moment: Hillbilly, Trapper, Nurse (Last Breath DLC), Wraith, and Michael Myers (Halloween DLC) from the 'Halloween' movie franchise.   The survivors are Dwight, Nea (Last Breath DLC), Laurie (Halloween DLC), Jake, Meg, and Claudette. Both the killers and survivors all have unique abilities but can also have one time use add-ons and offerings. To get these offerings and add-ons you have to unlock them via the blood web in which you spend blood points. Blood points are earned at the end of every match and the higher amount you get determines how good you did throughout the match. For example as the killer if you face camp a survivor while they are on the hook and don't let anyone rescue him/her then the blood points you earn at the end will be significantly lower. Plus then the other survivors can turn on the generators undisturbed. It should also be said that if one survivor is still alive out of the four then a trapdoor opens somewhere in the level and if the survivor already knows where it is they can escape the match.   But all that being said one of my biggest pet peeves in this game is when you have 4 survivors all with ♥♥♥♥ing toolboxes in their hands and they go around the level sabotaging ALL of your hooks except for the basement hooks which severely hinders the killer. I think this needs to be nerfed really, really bad. Plus the infinite window hopping where the survivors just take you around in circles and no matter what you do you'll never catch them and then they proceed to teabag the ground while your left standing there looking at them. Yeah that's another one. There are some levels like MacMillan Estate and Hadonfield (infinite rooftop camping B.S.) where this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t takes place the most and most survivors know to get all of the offerings that give them a good chance of being sent to those particular levels.  Other than that malarchy this game is still a blast to play. But do I recommend it. Yes. Is it worth $20? Yes. Are the survivors too OP. Hell yes! Is Micheal Myers too OP? Depends on who's using him.",1,0

Normally I refuse to buy downloadable games for $60, but I made an exception with this game because I was watching a few Battle Royale streams on Twitch. I pulled the plug and bought it, downloaded Battle Royale and Breaking Point, and just got consumed with it. Would I recommend this game at $60: Yes, would I recommend this game at &lt;60$: YES! If you can get Arma on sale then BUY IT RIGHT NOW. So here's the deal, I paid $60, and I would probably do it again without regrets, in fact, I DO regret not getting it earlier. To find out why it's easily worth the money you spend, keep reading, I'll tell you why.   Arma is so easy to pump time into because of this magical PC ability that we take for granted: MODS! A good round of Battle Royale where you get into the top 5 remaining players can last a good 45 minutes to an hour. Then there's Breaking Point; When you hop on to a TeamSpeak with your friends and start a group on Breaking Point, you can easily pump 3+ hours into the game in one session.  TL;DR:    You don't just play Arma, you get consumed in it.   Buy it now. It's   worth   it.",1,0

This made the Payday community angry so that is why there are so many negative reviews and OVERKILL is in such deep sh*t (Pardon the language) BUT I do not feel that this deserves a bad review as Payday 2 is still a great game, and it would be rather silly to leave a bad review for one mistake.

359060,Switch Galaxy Ultra,"Switch Galaxy Ultra has its charm and appeal, however, the PC port of this game has some glaring issues that need to be addressed in order to be a proper PC port.  The game supports NO mouse controls for menu navigation whatsoever, the sound settings only have Music/Effects on/off, there are no graphics settings at all, except for toggling lights and shadows. The worst of these offenders has to be the fact that although the game settings imply it has several different languages you can choose from to play the game, it defaults to your OS/your country's language WITH NO WAY TO CHANGE IT IN-GAME OR ON STEAM SETTINGS. This is a really serious issue, especially for people who want to record gameplay for websites like Youtube and Twitch, who would rather have everything in English. But if only the translations were good enough to warranty playing it in my native language. Unfortunately, the game suffers from near Google-translate levels of translation (regarding PT-PT/PT-BR) and it really detracts from the experience overall.  Gameplay is simple and ramps up difficulty nicely, Levels start slow enough, introducing mechanics little by little so the player can get accostumed to solving problems at higher speeds. As it is at the moment, I cannot recommend the PC version as is. If the issues I've outlined are fixed later on in the game's lifespan and with support for post-release by the devs it that happens, I will re-evaluate this review.",-1,1

394360,Hearts of Iron IV,"WW2, nuff said. Kidding TL;DR Typical World War 2 Strategy game, buy it anyway  Update: Another overpriced ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC with content that should've been in the base game. It probably was and they just removed it. Honestly, if you're willing to save up for over priced DLC, then go ahead and buy it  It's overall a decent instalment to the series, but this is one of a long line of lack lustre games released by Paradox. I've actually talked with someone whose worked with them. If you played any recent title from them like Stellaris or Hoi4, you may have felt like a lot of content was missing or there was just something lacking from the game and unused features. This is practically on purpose. They're stifling creativity and cancelling features to steam roll producing these games and also pushing content to DLC so they can charge you more. A lot of developers are doing this now and it's disgusting. While I do overall enjoy the game, It feels like it's a hollow shell of what it should be in certain places. The air combat is pretty much just production spamming them and wasting man power. Basically throwing your manpower and production away to get 'air superiority', a glorified buff to a region that's required for things like dropping the atom bomb or successfully landing paratroopers. The air combat is so just unit spamming and buffs, you'll forget it's even there. Diplomacy is probably the worst I've seen in a game. It's really fun to play in single player because you can go to max speed without the game crashing, because anything below max speed feels like you're waiting hours for things to happen and single battles to end. It's slower than victoria 2. Trade is also pretty stupid and useless. It would be better if it was just automated with prompts to tell you what's going on with your trade. If they release another game like this, despite all the swedes at Paradox, I don't think I can justify buying another one of their games. Actually ♥♥♥♥ that, I'll buy all paradox games.

57690,Tropico 4,"There's a special place in my heart for the Tropico series. I still consider the first Tropico one of the best gaming experiences of my life. Unfortunately, none of the sequels have significantly evolved past the design of the original - and indeed, the challenge has largely regressed.  My primary issues with Tropico are: 1. Every game plays out quite similarly. You'll end up building the same buildings (Tenement, Church, Clinic, etc), in around the same order every game. The primary mechanism of differentiation is via your economy: will you farm, mine, industrialize, and/or suck tourists dry. Regardless of what you choose... 2. You'll swim in money, triviliazing one of the central 'goals' of sims which is maintaining a balanced economy. Esp. in Tropico 3 and 4, it's far too easy to make money and just build whatever you want. Where's the challenge? 3. There's little incentive to be a militant dictator, regardless of how they've marketed the game.   What do I love about Tropico? 1. The setting. 2. That every citizen is modeled. 3. That you will be rewarded for efficient city-planning. 4. It's playful ambience.  If you asked me what my favorite city-builder was, I'd be hard-pressed to decide between Tropico (any version, except 2) or Sim City (my personal favorite was Sim City 4). I like the crunchiness and difficulty of Sim City, but the atmosphere and relaxation of Tropico.",1,0

Also got to run around said simulated city killing people and destroying things, playing the role of a super villain. Split personality much?! All this whilst listening to a great playlist of in-game music. The character customization is also brilliant, could spend forever perfecting the look of my character and well the fashion is fun too.

You can't really take it too seriously, the humour is all part of the appeal. Play it people, you know you want to. :D",1,0

It is a wonderful experience that any gamer should have, or at least try out. Give it a go, you won't regret it!  EDIT: this was written two years ago, and now I've come to play it for over 1000 hours, and I still get back to it from time to time, with the same impact and the same addictive gameplay that I know and love. The devs keep adding amazing content to it and the game never ends, you can play it forever and enjoy every minute of it. This is why I nominated Terraria for the 'Test of Time' award.",1,0

270550,Yet Another Zombie Defense,"'Yet Another Zombie Defense' is a co-op game where you and your friends have to kill zombies on a small map, that is the only point ... but that is pretty fun ! Up to 4 players can fight together, using a man, a girl or a member of the SWAT (the only difference is the skin, nothing else).    There are two modes.   The first one is the defense mode. You have to survive waves of zombies over and over until the end of your lives. Each time you kill a zombie, you get some dollars plus from time to time money, medic kit (enables your team to recevor health) or ammo (you need to have at least one weapon to get ammo, that does not take into account the pistol that you have at the beginning because you have infinite ammo for this specific weapon). After each wave, you recover your health but the zombies get stronger : they will deal more damage to you if they bite you, they will be faster and you will need more and more hits to kill them.  In order to survive, you are able and you have to use your money between each wave. You can buy different weapons (rifles, shotgun, flame thrower, tesla, rocket launcher, laser, ...), but always remember to have enough ammo tu use them ! Tip : I think the best way to go is to buy only one weapon so that, when a zombie drops ammo, you only get the adequate type of ammo. If you have two or more weapons, you are going to drop at random two types of ammo, and if you are looking for one specific kind, you might be unlucky and get the other one.  You can also buy barricades (wooden and steel) and auto-turrets and place them on the map, almost wherever you want within a medium circle from the center of the map. You can build up to 5 turrets, and for each of them, you have to buy and mount a weapon on it to get it active. Them, each time the turret shoots a zombie, it will use your ammo, so be carfeul with your stock ! The idea is to protect your turrets with barricades because zombies can destroy them, and since they are pretty expensive, you have to keep them alive.  Remember that only the host of the game can buy stuff and place items. You can ask for specific weapons, but the host has the final decision. I think that you should spend the first four or five waves killing the zombies with your pistol (which is free thanks to inifinite ammo), then you are likely to buy the weapon you like the most. There are also 'sales !' : at random, between each wave, some items are going to be cheaper (-25% I guess), so you might want to wait if you are looking for a specific item and maybe get lucky after the next wave, unless you die ...  In the end, you have to get the highest score you can to get your name on the leaderboard.     The second mode is the endless night. As indicated, there is only one wave of zombie, but there is no end to it ! No money on this map, no barricade or even turret to build, you have to kill zombies with weapons. There is a lot of zombies and they can drop weapons : as soon as you pick one of them, you have to use it, you cannot get your previous weapon back (unless you drop it again). The aim is to survive as long as possible, so try to gather medic kits when you need one of them, and never stop running !    To conclude, this game is pretty fun, maybe it is lacking a little bit of content, but with two modes, Steam trading cards and 18 achievements to unlock (5 hours should be enough to get them all), it is worth its price, which is quite low currently :)",1,0

211160,Viking: Battle for Asgard,"My main complaint is with the combat, and the explanation of it. As far as I can tell, it's all about getting into a safish position, mashing left mouse, and making sure you don't get surrounded. I was looking for something like Dark Souls, with tight, intuitive combat, or an Arkham-like style. This is not that game.  I didn't complete the first zone. I got to the training arena, expected to be informed of how to fight, and instead found a vendor with combo button press moves unlocked with gold which must be picked up from hidden caches around the map.  My secondary complaint is with the writing. Everyone insists the player character is possessed by something, and to be fair he was brought back from death at the beginning. All the people who have been held prisoner since well before the player character was killed all seem to know about this, and are suspicious.",-1,0

201810,Wolfenstein: The New Order,"What a hidden Treasure!  When I first saw the previews for Wolfenstein: The New Order I was not impressed at all. It looked like a bad clone of Borderlands with a world war 2 steampunk coating. Everything looked goofy and grey with nothing taken seriously; not the story, not the gameplay, nothing. However a few months after it came out I saw the opening level and I somehow became intruiged so I bought it on Steam. And then my mind was blown.  The opening level alone demonstrates everyting this game has to offer. Cinematic flare, fluid and respsonsive gameplay, a gripping original story and enough content to keep you playing for a good while. Lets start with the story. The setting and 'what if' scenario is used to great effect. Every character has purpose and every location feels varied, interesting and not unneccesary. Even the player character of Captain Blasckowitz comes across as a person wiith a soul. And best of all it was taken very seriously. The only over-the-top aspect is the violence which only helps the narrative and the gameplay. In short; the story is great.  The gameplay matches the campaign. The shooting feels accurate, nimble and responsive which will make you enjoy it all the more when you kill nazis. Every level is open and well designed and each setting feels distinct and memorable, particularly the opening compound assault and the nazi moon base. Each weapon feels powerful, made better by the ability to duel-wield any of your choice. Two shotguns down a narrow hallway full of a dozen nazis is one of the most fun gameplay scenarios I've ever known.   This is aided by the game's pacing. Each level has a decent length without having you overstay your welcome. It will most likely take around 12 or more hours to complete the storyline of the first campaign, yes the first. Depending on a choice you make in chapter one, the game has 2 campaigns with different plot points in each. Even the cinematic sequences are compelling. The graphics are also well made. They seem very similar to that of RAGE but with just a little more polish, which makes sense considering that this game and that have the same makers.  However some issues remain. There is no multiplayer, only the campaigns. Also the differences in each campaign are mostly minor which might make relplays unappealing for some. Finally the download is quite heafty so you'll need a decent set-up to store everything. That said, Wolfenstein works well on most systems.  Bottom line; The game is well-worth playing. This sort of game deserves more recognition. Great story with strong gameplay and worthy content makes for a masterful game. An unexpected gem.",1,0

Rockstar only cares if you aren't buying shark cards, which results in hackers who grief and kill entire lobbies getting away scott free, and people who spawn themselves money getting banned despite doing nothing other than hurting rockstar's bottom line. On top of this, the online gameplay is extremely grindy and rockstar's strict anti-hacking policies have caused them to mostly alienate the community. I've had several friends banned for doing nothing other than possibly being around hackers, who they couldn't avoid, and I myself was banned for no apparent reason. I've stuck by this game for years, and put thousands of hours into it between ps3, ps4, and pc, but after watching rockstar turn one of my favorite games as a half-♥♥♥♥♥ micro transaction farm and completely alienate the community as a whole, I can no longer recommend it.",-1,0

Because the puzzles do not change between playthroughs, the replay value of the game is rather small. If you are willing to accept those flaws, then let's talk about what's good.  The art in the game is absolutely gorgeous and fits amazingly well with the calming music.   The puzzles are 'different' from the standard puzzles found in RPGs or adventure games. The difficulty does increase and it quickly reaches a point where you will start running around in circles trying to figure out a certain puzzle.    Is it worth it?",1,0

405900,Disgaea PC,"TL;DWTR - A tactics RPG with ridiculous stat capping, humorous/goofy dialogue, and enough grind to last hundreds of hours. Recommended. ------------------------ As always, my recommendation comes with a disclaimer that your experiences will vary. Please read through at least the next paragraph.  Let's tackle everyone's main issue with this port... performance. Good God, launch day was a disaster for a lot of players, even those with high-spec PCs. But, interestingly enough, I have a mid-tier rig running 2.5-year-old hardware (i5-4460 3.2GHz + R7 260X 2GB), and Disgaea PC works fine. I'm honestly not sure where everyone's frame drops are coming from. I tested using new/old map textures, SSAO (which I didn't like personally, but it still didn't impact my performance too much), and all the other minor graphical tweaks...no sudden drop in FPS for me. So I'm probably really lucky that it runs perfectly fine... and as such I'm going to ignore factoring in performance for my review. Just be warned that if the game doesn't run smoothly for you, the rest of this review is pointless and you should return this game until NISA (Nippon Ichi Software, America) sorts things out.  NISA seems to be on point and fixing a lot of the issues with the game's performance currently, as Disgaea PC's rating has increased from 67% (Mixed) to 85% (Very Positive) after the first few weeks of bug fixes.   Disgaea PC is a port of Afternoon of Darkness on the PSP, which is an enhanced remake of the original PS2 title, Hour of Darkness. This is the third remake of Hour of Darkness, after Afternoon of Darkness and Disgaea DS for Nintendo DS systems.  Disgaea (the series) is a tactical RPG (grid-based, turn-based, action points, the usual deal) with its key selling point being the ability to grind out your stats and level to absurd highs. The caps for stats and level are insanely high (~20 million for each stat in Disgaea PC and 9999 for level). There's a lot of bonus maps, content, and endings to access that the game acknowledges how many New Game Pluses you've done. I love grindy games, and so I figured Disgaea was right up my alley. Sure enough, I've played and enjoyed the hell out of Hour of Darkness and Cursed Memories. Haven't played 3, 4, D2, or 5 yet since I don't own a PS3/4.  Another highlight of the Disgaea franchise is the Item World, a completely randomized dungeon crawl generated from items you collect in the game. By exploring the Item World, you can grab more items, grind out EXP, and improve that item's stats. Each item contains an expansive dungeon of 30, 60, or 100 floors, depending on the item's rarity.  I'd have to argue a minor problem with the mechanics is just how many different systems they've jammed into this game. There's the tactical combat, which is simple enough to understand... then they introduce Geo Panels and Effects, Lifting and Throwing allies, enemies, and Geo Effects...the Dark Assembly, Pupils, Skill/Stat Inheritance between Master and Pupil, the Item World, Reincarnation (Transmigration in this version), and some mechanics the game doesn't even cover such as Elemental Affinities (Fire, Wind, Ice), Status Effects, and Weapon Masteries. For a newcomer this may seem like a daunting amount of things to learn about... and believe me, it is. However, all of these things don't need to be used...in fact the game even tells you, you can beat the game with 'minimal game knowledge'. The systems are there to provide hardcore players the means to be more efficient in grinding out those stats.  I won't go into nor analyze the story (because I suck at analysis and not spoiling), but I will say it's decent and humorous enough to suffice as an RPG plot. I also will not criticize the graphics because I don't really care for them, but the port made the map and character art look better than the PS2 graphics. There is also an option to change the graphics back to the old PS2 game, for that old nostalgic feel (I guess). EDIT: I completely forgot about the Keyboard+Mouse (the mouse kinda messed the cursor movement up for me, so I turned it off...but you could technically play the game using just the mouse if you wanted to... also mouse click detection is a bit bugged) and Gamepad support (which is a little clunky to detect). That's there as well. I suppose I should also add that the port added custom resolution support. (you can resize the screen to your desire)  Overall, I'd give this game a solid 8/10. Good for RPG fans, grind-fest lovers, and people who just want a lot of content for their buck.  Score Breakdown: Story/Plot/Characters: 9/10 (each character seems unique in their own way, dialogue gave me a couple laughs, story was dramatic at times - but not overly so when it was) Music: 8/10 (pretty good soundtrack, still waiting for my digital dood/pre-order soundtrack bonus) Graphics/Art: 5/10 (has a nice theme to it, but even with the new textures the game looks dated, plus the new character filter thing just blurs the pixels so your characters look like a smudge on the screen... wtf?) Mechanics: 9/10 (lots of cheesing you can do with unit movement, lifting, and AoE attacks, maybe intentional, but overall great mechanics Value: 10/10 (hours and hours and hours and hours of content and grind) Performance: 8/10 (works fine on my rig - stays notably above 60fps most of the time - others not so much... EDIT: I am now getting crashes more often, and I'm not sure why. Maybe the math and numbers are getting too high? Either way, dropping 2 points off performance. It shouldn't be crashing because of memory leaks or integer over/underflow.)  Oh yeah, I should add: Buy it for the Prinnies, dood!",1,0

200510,XCOM: Enemy Unknown,"I absolutely love this game. I could spend way more than a hundred hours on it and I probably will eventually. The strategy feels real, the player is in complete control of his forces in the battlefield during intense battles. Throughout the game the player has the ability to choose his own preferred methods of upgrading his units. The more you play the easier it gets because you can use your research to jump past certain technologies allowing you to progress at your own speed. Making the game absolutely feel like the player has gotten his full moneysworth.   The DLC Enemy Within is also worth buying because of the new mechanics and care added to the game. It's a little odd that the characters have their entire bodies replaced, but that is the way it works in this universe.",1,0

226700,Infestation: Survivor Stories 2020,"War Z or Infestation: Survivor Stories (And please don't ask me why its called that) is a game that should really be played before judging. Now its pretty clear that some of the people writing reviews are pretty much Day Z Supporters, which isn't a bad thing after all. But its there negative attention towards the game itself that really pulls it down. I guarantee you that if you had never saw those reviews or had compared it to Day Z yourself. You would actually love the game, because it is good. So, whilst this might be contradicting myself, lets just compare it to Day Z. We'll start with the main aspect of the game, Zombies. In this game, they're a huge threat to newly spawned players where in DayZ, a simple sprint and 4.5 metre gap between you of them makes you in the clear. Gun play is my next choice, another aspect that will dictate the course of your gameplay. Simply aiming in Day Z feels like a pain, and with everyshot being a beacon to zombies, that shot will be something to regret in the future.  I'm done, I truly am done, this game is a ♥♥♥♥ing piece of ♥♥♥♥, I can't write a review on a game that literally sucks balls. If you buy this game, you'll regret it. The experience in War Z is like having a broken leg that is holding on by a single muscle. I can't get it out there enough to make you stop buying it, I even put this in the thumbs up section so you'd read it. By putting the thumb up I actually meant 'up yours developers'.

How nice would it be to see a well known retailer or coffee shop from your town or country pop up in the game?

248820,Risk of Rain,"This game is a wee gem in my opinion.  The game is basically: you choose your surviver from a mysterious spaceship crash where each surviver has it's own skillset. On the planet you figure that as time goes on, your enemies become stronger but so can you. Killing monsters nets xp and gold and that gold you can use to open chests or buy support drones. Clearing an area isn't necessary (but recommended) and the goal is to find the teleporter in each area, proceed to the final area and defeat that which caused the crash of your damn cargo-spaceship (and then fly out into space with whatever is left again).  You can have shorter sessions (especially the first time you play you'll likely die in the first area..) but my personal sessions have lasted longer than a couple of hours (not normal by the way, but playing around with artifacts is just that fun hehe. About that, there's a gameplay altering artefact found in every area that you can activate before starting a game once you've found it atleast once before. Glass is OP, Command too.).  It's a good game and it's deceptive in how long a game lasts, even with the clock ticking in the top right. Multiplayer is dope, there's still people around to play with but you'll have to stick your neck out and go to the community page. They don't have lobbies that connect just any person that wants to play together. ..So just get your friends to play too, or as I said find new ones in the community page :D  The game is definitely worth the dollas, can tell ya that.",1,0

391540,Undertale,"|-Spoiler Free Review-|  Undertale. A game so hyped up on certain corners of the internet you need to have your eyes closed to miss it. Luckily, I got to play it having only a few minor elements spoiled. A fresh run for all intents and purposes, which is the most recommended way to go in to it. After playing it myself, I also give that advice.   Many reviewers have differing opinions of what constitutes spoilers, so even spoiler free reviews may ruin small bits of the game. Tread carefully when reading other people's opinions on the game. I'll do my best not to include anything specific here.  On to the game:   Undertale is a 8 to 9 hour 8-bit story-driven rpg where your decisions in the story affect how the entire game plays out. Each decision you make changes how the other characters respond to your presence. This mechanic makes combat more meaningful in a genre where most fights are treated only as a means to grow stronger.   |-The Battle System-|   The battle system in Undertale is most similar to the Earthbound series. All the fighting takes place in turn-based combat from the perspective of the player character.  There are two twists to the formula.  1.) Enemy attacks are a form of top-down arcade shooter. Your ability to survive depends on how well you can dodge their unique patterns.  2.) Arguably the most important aspect of the game: You can attempt to spare every enemy you encounter.  Killing the monsters is usually quicker and easier than sparing them. On top of that, sparing monsters does not award the player with experience. With this in mind, the player needs to decide whether or not it is worth the trouble to leave each hostile enemy they meet alive.   |-The Story-|   The biggest reason most people try Undertale. Someone recommends the game and, more than likely, it is the first thing they'll talk about when trying to convince you.  Bottom line?  It's good. Not great, but good. It has a couple interesting twists here and there, but for the most part it follows a predictable path. Now that isn't necessarily a bad thing, but don't go in expecting a new classic of storytelling. If I get specific on the why it'll tread into spoiler territory, so let's move on to what I believe is the strongest part of the game.   |-The Characters-|   Undertale has a boatload of funny and endearing characters. Even the random battle enemies have unique personalities and interactions. Outside of the various areas you visit, they help to fill in the world and make it believable. In many rpgs random npcs mostly just have throwaway lines that don't have any impact on you at all. In Undertale they almost always have another joke to tell, or something that adds a little more to the overall story. It's definitely something I wish more games would do.  That's without starting on the main cast. In order to avoid spoilers I will say that for as much care and effort that went into the random npcs, much more was put into the named characters you encounter. Every one feels like they are necessary to the story, and none of them feel like they were tacked on just for the sake of it. Some of their interactions, on the other hand...   |-The Writing-|   For the most part, Undertale is well written. I wouldn't say it's a pinnacle of writing, but it does its job. It is servicable throughout, and there are only one or two times where it takes you out of the experience. Usually, this happens when the game is attempting to convey sadness, desperation, or sentimentality. It goes from heartfelt to hokey real quick. Some of those moments are well done, however.  The jokes are Undertale's strength. There are so many so frequently that I wonder if they started out with the idea that they were going to make a game with a ton of puns and awkward humor, and then try to fill in a story around the jokes. Most are well done but, as to be expected with so many attempts, some fall flat.   |-The Music-|   The music is great. If the characters are the strongest part of the game, the music is a close second. Like the characters, each piece of music makes each different area, situation, and boss fight feel all the more unique. From the monsters to the places they accompany. The retro-style of the music goes hand-in-hand with the visual style to create a cohesive world.   |-Overall-|   I played Undertale having only heard that it was good, and I tried it with relatively neutral expectations. In the time since, I have seen many people laud it as the game of the year (or all time, even). With that in mind, is Undertale as good as many people claim it to be?  In my opinion: No.  Undertale is good. It is worth playing. It is of a quality I wish every indie game would be. But it's not perfect, and its flaws were apparent to me as I played through it.  For many people, Undertale is the first game that they've played of this quality. The first game that gave them meaningful impact for the decisions they made. For them, it is the game of the year, maybe even the best game they've ever come across. It is none of these things for me, but that is not something I can hold against them.  All in all, Undertale is a game I am glad I played, regardless of its shortcomings.   8/10",1,0

47810,Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition,"Dragon Age: Origins is one oft, most likely the best Role-Play-Game I ever had the pleasure to encounter. The story is outright epic. The dialogue is written by pure genius, as might be suspected when playing a Bioware game and the characters are developed very lively and loveable. I've spent around 100 hours of ingame time and still haven't finished all there is to see. Multiple races and background stories give a great variety of charackter customization. Combat-wise you are controlling 4 party members (including yourself) and command them to use their various skill.

This game IS a part of the X-com universe but just a different take on it. If you like thinking on your feet then this is a good game. With the exception of a few minor glitches in the story and also some glaring mistakes this game is a good play. The story line is good up to a point and then the choices given later in the game are confusing with no real indication as to what to do. This game crashes a lot if you have physx turned on and especially in the dx11 version. I still ran into problems with poor frame rates and crashes using 780gtx sli.  So be warned.

241930,Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™,"The gameplay is amazing and fun.. until it ends. I beat this game in 15 hours. Thats the size of a 10 dollar game, not a 60 dollar one! Don't waste your money on this; the actual story is only 35% of the game. The rest is dumb collectables and repetitive missions; and the nemesis system? No replay value. Yeah sure, the bosses have different stats. Whoop de doo. You're still fighting thr same boring orcs in the same boring enviroment over, and over, and over again. 'Are the boss battles epic?' Not at all. To beat the END boss of the game, all you have to do is hit the spacebar a few times. Im being serious. Its a timed event where you need to hit space before the timer runs out, or else you need to retry. The other 'bosses?' The only one you actually fight is the first boss, and he is just building up your hit streak points so you can use a finisher on him.  Overall: DOnt waste your money on this trash.

235800,Audiosurf 2,"It's been a while since I've made a review of this game. My thoughts on it now have changed since my last review thankfully. One thing you may have noticed right off the bat is that I have put more hours into this. That's because I play it every now and again. Not everyday, but every once and a while I'll go 'Oh, I should play the Song of the Day to get that achievement'. Speaking of achievements, I will not do the ninja one, or the puzzle one because I wasn't a fan of the puzzle modes in the original Audiosurf and still not a fan now.   What I am a fan of though are the 'Mono' modes, both in the original and in this one. While the Mono modes in this game are drastically different in this game (it took me a while to get used to it the first time), I still like them. Sure the layout can change after every playthrough of it, but it gives a nice change of pace and a bit of challenge to it. Audiosprint is also pretty good too, I haven't played that mode in a while but I remember it being pretty good. I also remember Wakeboard mode being pretty confusing the first couple of times, but got used to it a little bit.  Another thing I'd like to talk about are the mods to this game. Granted, I do have very few of them, but there are so many more that I haven't even looked at yet, or even heard about! The one's I have are mostly skins like Dark Spectrum. I do have some game modes installed from the Workshop like True Ninja and all that. But other than that, I don't have much.  So overall, what do I think of this game now? Do I think it's a lot better now? Well I do have it marked down as Recommend now so yes, it is much better than I thought it was. Great graphics, good gameplay, and an extensive amount of songs via Soundcloud as well as mods. 8/10  P.S. I'm not gonna pull up my previous reviews here, as I feel like this is the one that I'm happy with.  P.P.S. I figured out how to play CDs in this game.

291410,NA,"I find chess complicated - and I kid you not. I never was a fan and I don't think I will ever get a hang of playing it. Ever.  And yet here I am giving a thumbs-up to a game that's basically an evolution of that game. Or maybe it's chess on steroids. I don't know why I am hooked on it.  Maybe it's because you play out of a hand - which is more liberating and more variable than chess. It takes inspiration from a lot of games both old and even new, and makes it better.   I am not limited to diagonal, straight-line, or L-shape movements - I have six factions to build my army from, offering a load of uniquely designed minions and spells in colorful 8-bit artworks. A pawn can victoriously become your knight or queen with the right combination of cards. (and a little bit of luck on the draw)  Or maybe it's the fact that matches are short and sweet (and brutally satisfying) yet always different in every way due to the multitude of options the game throws at you.   Or perhaps it's the fact that it made me think of chess out of the blue - maybe getting a grip of 'two steps ahead' will help me ladder. How it makes me wish that I knew the age old game better.  It's colorful. It's complex. It's addicting. It's Duelyst.  Post Season Review - here are additional thing you should know before getting into it. I still like the game but it is turning out to be a love-hate relationship.  1) The kickstarter rewards - well the most basic at least - doesn't give you a big advantage. It would have if I started playing as soon as it was F2P but I didn't. So any duplicate cards that I have really didn't prove any much help. People starting just now will have to work hard into building their decks.  2) You will eventually fight the same deck designs during the duration of the season. Either you will be tempted to fight a mirror match to see who uses the current flavor or just have a not so good win ratio with your original or not-so-hot deck at the moment.   3) The temptation of spending real money is high. If you're new and did not back up the kickstarter project, there will be a lot of catching up. At the very least you will have to get the 10 Pack Starter. I don't know how much of an advantage the new Division Packs will bring, knowing that the players who have been at it for a very long time would have access to both the Bronze and Silver packs at the very least. The willingness to put out cash is equal to game veterans and starters. (and all will still bow to RNG-esus)  P.S. For a Trading Card Game, there's no trading involved. I hope there was some way that people can actually exchange cards to build that sense of community with the likes of Magic The Gathering.",1,0

234080,Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Ultimate Edition,"First, I'll say I'm a rather big Castlevania fan. I'll go ahead and list the pros of this game:  It has a few nods here and there to the original games and their lore. It's very visually and audibly appealing. The combat, for the most part, is kind of fun. The story isn't too bad, and the voice acting is surprisingly good as well. The game has a great atmosphere.  Now for the bad: The 2nd biggest strike against this game, in my opinion, is the pacing. You'll progress a bit only to be stopped by a group of enemies. This gets more annoying as the game progresses, with the inclusion of more enemies and tougher enemies.  SOME of the puzzles are tolerable. However, as the game goes on, you'll find they get more tedious and more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The biggest puzzle I had an issue with is later on in the game, in the    Frankenstein lab    level. Here, there are two big problems. Firstly, you need to buy a special move with experience in order to solve a puzzle. While you'd definitely have the experience necessary for the move, the fact that the game expects you to do something that is considered optional in order to move on in the game is really counter-intuitive. Additionally, this move is a bit inaccurate and hard to control, leading to further aggravation solving a puzzle which by its nature is already rather aggravating.  Another thing about puzzles. Some of them are trial-and-error by nature. This alone is bad game design. It would be ok to have MAYBE one or two trial-and-error puzzles, but this game feels like it has too many of them. It ALMOST got it right, I will say that much, but it didn't get it right enough.  While I mentioned that combat is fun, and it is, as you encounter more groups of obvious-filler enemies, you find that combat can be tedious and boring. It all boils down to mash the X and Y buttons. It's nice that the game gives you options in your combat with advanced moves, but it really tends to not make much of a difference. Going along with this, the shadow and light magic abilities you get don't tend to change up combat much, essentially making a gameplay mechanic useless.  And the final, biggest strike against this game: 'difficulty.' Now I say that I haven't gotten a game over in this game sans one time. However, this game's idea of difficulty is to continually add fluff and padding with more enemies, more tedious puzzles, and the worst is when it combines these two. Often I found myself facing a puzzle and I just knew 'Ugh, I'll have to face a group of enemies which will only hold off the oncoming aggravation.'  I really wanted to like this game, and for the most part I still do, however I think it needs a bit of a design touch-up. While I know games will lessen the hand-holding as you progress, which is natural for games to do, I think this game didn't hand-hold in the right places.  Overall, I'd say play it and give it a shot, but I wouldn't pay 30 dollars for it. (At the time of writing, the game is priced at 29.99)",-1,0

235620,Small World,"This is a brilliant adaptation of the aweome board game... if you've played the board game then I assure you that this is an authentic replicate of the samne game, including the expansions. If you've never played it, then just watch the video, it's vair straight forward to figure out.  There's a major, and a minor, problem them; Trying to play online is like pulling teeth. Constant 'authentication' problems with people trying to log in. Getting a game going is extremely frustrating because of this. (That said, when you're actually playing it's a smooth ride IME).  The other minor problem is something that the board game suffers from too but it can't be helped there... they could have fixed it here and didn't. I play games like this with my family; there's 3 of us that play. That means when we play the board game we're always stuck on the 3 player board... never used the 2, 4 or 5 player board. In the computer game although you can play against the AI in single player, you can't have the same bots in multiplayer... if you could you could have 3 people, and 2 AIs. A big missed opportunity.  Like many people (probably) I got this from Humble, so it seems harsh to be negative about a game for charity, but if you're getting this for multiplayer, don't bother. Single player is fine though.",-1,0

248310,Freedom Planet,"Fast-paced 2D side-scrolling action with 3 different characters to play as, each having a different number of levels to play through.  Lilac is the main protagonist, porbably the fastest of the 3 playable characters. She can dive kick and spin jump for extra momentum and do damage. She can also do a mid-air dash which launches her across the screen really fast in whatever direction you were holding.  Carol is a wildcat who has a lot of extra moving options. She can dash forward when jumping and climb on walls. Her special allows her to rapidly kick infront of her, doing massive damage. In each of her levels, there's a gas canistor that allows you to get onto her bike and ride throughout the level. Said bike can also ride ON WALLS.  Milla is some kind of dog character? Idk but her levels are probably the more calming of the other 2, as she isn't the fastest but has really unqiue skills. She can spawn a Phantom Block that she can throw at enemies, she can also pick up other objects in the level. She has a Shield that'll redirect enemy projectiles, which also acts as a damage attack when the shield is deactivated. Using your shield while holding the cube will make a supr shield burst which is a large blast. Not only that, but she can also flutter in the air for a short time. She also has the ability to dig on dirt and soil, spawning items.  The game also has a Gallery section which contains soundtracks and voice lines from your 3 heroines! In every level, there's 10 (I think) Tarot Cards you can find hidden in the levle that will unlock these soundtracks and voice lines.  This is a great game if you love 2D side-scrollers. I hear a lot of people call Freedom Planet a Classic Sonic the Hedgehog clone but to me Freedom Planet does so much more than that. Throughout my time playing it I was never reminded of playing the old Sonic, Freedom Planet is something different, similar, but different.",1,0

266230,Last Dream,"What can I say, wow!  I highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoyed the NES and SNES era of RPGs. If you are a person who has bought several versions of final fantasy games, enjoy customizing characters and seeking out rare treasures to make your party incredibly powerful, or are a trophy hunter who enjoys a serious challenge to collect all achievements, this is the game for you.   This game is a polished experience of the classic RPG. If this game had come out 20 years ago, you would be having debates on whether Last Dream belongs in the top 3 RPGS along with Final Fantasy 6 and Chrono Trigger. The graphics are cheerful and colorful, and the music is a collection of great classical pieces, and you will find yourself humming along, and even recognizing many of them, and feeling cooler for doing so!  While I beat the game within 40 hours the first time, the achievements added 100+ hours of replay-ability. You see, there are around a hundred achievements, some of which can't be completed in one playthrough. You have to do multiple playthroughs, and it took me some serious planning, but I managed to get them all done in 3 playthroughs. It is single-handedly the most fun achievement hunting I have ever done in a game.  I look forward to Last Dream Expansion and Last Dream II.",1,0

It's unfair and bias and far from a 'hardcore' fps. No one works together as a team, and you can only do well in numbers on this game.

There are a few achievement changes, including a more difficult one, Overlord but it can also be easy to get a perfect game in. This one also adds a 'thief' element that can steal your supplies. While I find it adds a fascinating aspect to the strategy of the game, it can also be infuriating at times and puts on emphasis on having to rush things. This makes the game a bit of a less 'casual' strategy compared to the first since you are on even more of a 'time crunch.' It's still enjoyable and a fun little gem.  Pros: -More strategy aspects -New 'puzzle' aspect -Variety of new elements, including thieves -Fairly easy achievements -Same great art, music, gameplay  Cons: -Looped music -Theives stealing my shiz (T.T) -Feels a tad short still (but I like the additional levels!)

65980,Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth,"I'm a huge fan so far, like it a lot more than Civ 5. Mostly cause it feels more open and flexible and you can adapt a lot of things to your playstyle or specific circumstances. So it feels a lot less rigid than Civ 5.  All in all, the game does a fantastic job of letting you chose a lot of things that you could never chose in Civ 5, it makes most decisions actually meaningful instead of just going-through-the-motions (as I felt after a while with Civ 5, though that might just be me ofc). The Health-system isn't as punishing, so you can expand a lot more earlier without getting a growth penalty. In the same way it's also a lot more rewarding, giving you percentage increase in culture/science/production, if you keep your health above a certain level instead of a one time boost with golden ages.  The Virtues are a lot better designed than the culture stuff in Civ 5, as you're not so much restricted anymore, there are diffferent advantages to spreading yourself thin and getting into two or three virtue trees as well as focusing on a single one.  Also, you get a lot more options for military a lot earlier (carrier,air, satellites) which in Civ 5 would be very late in the game (and which I would often not use at all because of that, cause at that point, when I could build air units, I'd usually just race for the victory and not bother with military anymore). So I found the combat aspect a lot more fun because of that. Also there's somethign really satisfying about attacking with a giant robot spider for instance :D  Quests that pop up during the game and can take a lot of sub-quests till you finsih it, not only are nice for rewards, but also tell a story, which gives the world you're in and your actions some context, which I found very cool, given that this is a 4x game it's a nice way of adding some narrative and story to it, without diverting too much from the game.  Victory conditions feel a lot more solitary though. The only one where there's a forced interaction is the domination victory, with all the others you just build some Building somewhere and protect it for a certain amount of turns and then win. And unless the AI tries to actively stop you by attacking there isn't much interaction going on on that front. And there isn't even a scoreboard at the end. And if you lose you won't even know what caused it, so that's one of the most dissapointing aspects of the game and feels very anti-climactic.  Overall I'm having a lot of fun with the game though and I can recommend it. Though, as the general rule is with games that cost more than 10 bucks: Watch some reviews, let's plays, see if the things you can do ni the game are things you'd enjoy or if you'd be rather missing stuff from other Civ games. From the reviews and discussion, it's clear that there are a lot of people that are dissapointed with the content, so obviously, do your own research, before buying the game.",1,0

Considering their significant involvment during the last and painful moments of life of the few remaining cells i had, devs of this game are invited to attend the ceremony and, if they want to, say a few words about their bravery.  I don't know if i like this game or not. I played it, i finished it (somehow) and i'm very confused about what i saw and experienced.  It takes about 2 hours to finish the game, and although that can seem short, let me assure you it's in fact just enough. This was an intriguing, a bit exhausting, and yet intersting experience.  Description says 'The main idea behind the game is to make the player appreciate the loneliness, the feeling to be lost in a gigantic unknown universe and to be marvelled by the beauty of this world.', and i think this goal is fully achieved. Level design is really impressive and you often stop running just to admire.  However, i think the game is a bit overpriced.

I tried joining and restarting the game several times, however, this didn't keep my character from walking on his own :-)   Furthermore, even without this handicap, this game is UNPLAYABLE. I saw multiple bugs and glitches. Such as zombies not taking damage / Being able to eat food multiple times / Zombies turning into trees / Zombies walking into the corner of a room, then suddenly dying out of nowhere, I can go on, but don't feel like even wasting the time.  When I died and waited a few minutes to respawn, the game crashed and gave me a crash report, telling me it would be great if I sent that to the developer of the game.

444970,Spatial Sound Card,"Update(After Comment by Tom- Developer): It seems software is FINALLY working now. I had a bit of trouble trying to figure out what to use it on- finally settled on Bioshock Infinite- and let me tell you- playing it without and with, is night and day! Have the SSC set to 7.1 Shanghai Beyerdynamic DT 770M, and it just envelopes you in the surroundings- every scream, gunshot, broadcast- even the wind, you are totally aware of it suddenly. Glad I was convinced to give this another try :)   For those of you having problems with still distorted audio and the like- ensure you're playing music, or software with high enough fidelity. I usually import my music at 320K and iTunes automatically splits it into stereo- this becomes obvious upon playback when using this software, as the software is stripping the stereo channels into separate channels, and it doesn't sound very good- not the software's fault- just something to keep in mind-GIGO (Garbage-In-Garbage-Out).   tldr; I would complately recommend this software now- seems like most kinks are worked out, and it's a good deal for more immersive gaming.  _____________________________________________________________________________________________  Update (A week later):  I have received no reply from dev either from this review, or from the discussion page as dev had requested. I am requesting a refund. A word of advice, until issues are fixed and or dev starts fixing the problems, I would recommend holding off on this.   Original: Sorry, I also cannot get this APP to work, even after I read that the dev had released an update to bind to WASAPI, but I figured I'd give it a try. I could also not get this to work after I installed the trial version directly from New Audio Technology, but I figured I'd give this version a shot- especially with the dev saying he updated it.   Problems (If you care to read): Cannot get sound to output through headphones using software as default playback device- unless I run the software in stereo mode (which kinda' defeats the purpose I must admit). The only way I'd been able to get the software to work otherwise is to go into recording devices, and set my headphones to 'listen' to this recording device on playthrough... this also defeats the purpose, as it does not allow controlling of sound directions- it just patches through.   For reference I'm running Windows 10- using Steelseries Siberia V2 headset (USB). I watched some Youtube Videos on this software, and the demonstrations are incredible! I'm sure if this software would work properly it would be amazing. Dev- you seem great like you're working on stuff, I'm willing to try anything if you have any ideas- I tried looking up my problems online and couldn't seem to find anything. I'll certainly update my review if any fixes are made.",1,0

32370,STAR WARS™: Knights of the Old Republic™,"I got this game from my grandma for Christmas when it released. I never really had any experience with RPG games and I was really young but I could understand the dialogue well enough to love it. I'm still very young today but back then, the game felt so epic and HUGE! I felt like each planet would take days to finish when in reality it only took a few hours. This was the only game I would ever play, I had to have replayed it over 40+ times and this isn't an exaggeration! Once KOTOR 2 came out I just had to get it, the game was fun but not as memorable as KOTOR 1. I remember being actually scared at points in this game. When I arrived to Malachor V, I literally was frightened to play it. The atmosphere and music was so grim and well done! Yesterday, I found my original XBOX along with both games, I checked my save files and WOW, did I play a lot of this game. The music is so nostalgic and a masterpiece! I decided to replay both games and it still holds up today as my favorite game of all time! KOTOR will forever be in my heart.﻿ I could write an entire 5 page essay on the game because of so much more I have to say about it. But I'll leave it at this, and I highly highly encourage you to try out this game. It may seem kind of stale to todays standards, but back then, it was next-gen. This was the only game that I played in my childhood, and I probably played it for 4 years straight without ever getting bored of it. Please give this game a chance and even the sequel the same. One other thing I would like to mention is how emotionally invested in the characters you can get into this game. I was attatched to multiple characters and they felt like they were my friends in real life. I haven't ever had this feeling until recently, with the masterpiece 'The Witcher 3', and honestly, it's amazing.",1,1

I'd love there to be some intro and cut-scenes to get us closer to our kerbalnauts. It's still not bug free and does have an air of indie/beta about it but this is one project that is being run correctly and has been a joy to support.  ------------------------------------------------- As of release (0.9B)  + Kerbal's are cute and fun to interact with (sent screaming into space) + The complex physics of space flight is accessible + Hugely sense of reward in achieving even small steps for Kerbal kind + Lots to do and experiment with + Regular updates and an active community of modders + Sound already is fun and adds to the atmosphere  ~ Graphics are not phenomenal but are appropriate ~ Loading times are unoptimised but nothing bad ~ Some interfaces are unrefined but totally functional  - Still in Beta so issues are forgiveable and probably being resolved - Tutorial leaves out useful info and needs expanding - Sponsorships are not easy to figure out and broken  What a hugely fun and charming game that demands your love and attention. You care about your dim lil Kerbal's and it's fun to see them flounder and succeed. The science is well packaged to be accessible and if you take the time to experiment and read around the subject it becomes all the more rewarding.  Recommended for those who like space, science and being educated as they are entertained.  Conclusion: 8/10. A work in progress you can invest hours of enjoyment in already.",1,1
279260,Richard & Alice,"This is a very simple point and click game, with a few choices that impact the ending (5 possible outcomes in total). This game is, in my opinion, below average in all regards. I'll start by the technical aspects, then go to gameplay/design choices, and finally I'll discuss the plot (I'll put it under spoilers, know that I will discuss all the twists, so don't read it if for some reason walking blind into a story is important for you).  Richard &amp; Alice uses the Adventure Games Studio engine, a freeware development tool specific for point and click games, although it has been used for other genres from time to time. The game is functionally fine, the sounds are sparse but okay, and the music fits the theme, even if it's not memorable. The game is also very short, even if you wander around like I did, you should take about 2 hours to complete it. Not much else to say, the game doesn't stray away from the classic point and click formula, so everything works as expected, although I have seen more impressive uses of the engine.  The gameplay, despite its semplicity, manages to be disappointing thanks to the incredibly slow movement speed, paired with a couple of large, empty screens, making exploration (or back-tracking) a painful experience. Most puzzles are very easy, although I would argue one in particular is asinine in the round about way you have to go through in order to solve it. Also disappointing is just how little gameplay there is, even for a point and click. The way the ending you get is determined is probably the only clever-ish thing about it, although the results are obfuscated by how indirect some of the cause-effect links are. There is a certain amount of forced back-tracking, which is not only slow, as mentioned before, but takes you through supremely bland screens. The art is subpar, It's even less interesting than standard RPGmaker tiles, and calling it functional is probably the only praise you can bestow upon it.  The plot is not really great. If you can't tell the first plot twist in the first 5 minutes, you probably aren't very observant, or are completely unable to detect obvious storytelling devices. The second twist is slightly harder to predict, but still qualifies as a no brainer, and these are really the only surprises in the game, the rest is played out in a completely straight manner. The world building is incredibly stupid, there is no rhyme nor reason for how society seems to be organized (what little you can see or hear of it), several events are left without explanations, the dialogues are just painful (I can't tell if the kid is supposed to have some learning disabilities, or if they just poorly imitated a 5 year old, and at least a few of the rare 'existential' dialogues are bland and trite, something you have likely heard before). Point and click games live and die by their story and characters, and this game doesn't provide witty, interesting, smart or likeable characters, and has to rely on the emotional crutch of family bonds for the most part just to be relatable.  Now, for the spoilers:    The kid is dead. It's painfully obvious, and the fact that is portrayed as a reveal it's a joke. The kid at least isn't as bad as children in other games, but only barely so. It's a cheap narrative tool that doubles as a way to manipulate you into feeling sorry for the characters. Whenever it's convenient, he'll do stupid stuff and be oblivious to his surroundings, so that you can have the story move forward, but he'll also be mature when required (and get sick to the point of no return, too). Thankfully, the game is short, so they can't drag this for too long, but it's still obvious and disappointing. You'll find several notes to read through the game, and not reading them all can affect the ending (very, VERY hard to miss them, unless you do so deliberately to get the other endings, which means you must have read a guide to know about it). The writing is a mixed bag in terms of quality here, some give you some interesting hints about what's going on, some are meant to paint the bleakness of this world, but it often isn't well put together, lacks depth or emotion, is generally unnecessary. Richard doesn't get much screen time, so you have to rely on the notes and the final parts of the game, to really flesh him out a bit. He is still a clichè, but at least he didn't mercy kill his own blood like Alice did, so at least he isn't THAT cliched. Alice is a joke, her lines are often baffling and awkward beyond the authors' intentions, (see the exchanges with Richard, or even the dialogue with the mysterious stranger in the church, supposedly the moral turning point that leads her to the decision to kill her son). The world building is disappointing, all is referred to in vague terms, but still that's what drives the characters to do what they do, something more substantial would be greatly appreciated. The game is short, so really there isn't anything worthwhile to mention beyond this.    In conclusion, despite me being very negative in the review, the truth is that it's 'just' a subpar game. Do not buy it, (there are much better games that tackle serious themes, while doing a much better job) unless you are really into point and click and you completely ran out of other games to play in the genre, and even then do not buy at full price, you can find better games for free, so spend your money wisely.",-1,0

341870,Tembo The Badass Elephant,"Tembo the Badass Elephant is a difficult platformer made by Japanese studio Game Freak (you may know them because of Pokémon RPG series) and published by SEGA. That shows a big promise, considering also the price of 13 euros, right?  Well, on the first look, the game have gorgeous visual style with comic features (typical comic interjections) that is pointed towards comedy - I mean even the game name suggests you can't take it much seriously, as your character is an army elephant who... is absolutely badass. (He could be the next Expendable!)  Difficulty of the game is high, you can't pick anything like casual difficulty there, so prepare to die (as Dark Souls taught me). But don't worry, it's not that hardcore, expect having few checkpoints and 5 lives per level (if you lose them, you just lose progress in specific stage).   Difficulty is also set high because of the unique movement of the elephant. As the elephant is heavier than average platformer character, your movement will be mostly horizontally wide but vertically short. Also, for attacks you can use only melee attacks (thanks to jumping and charging) but there's one more utility thing - you can splash water with your trunk. That's useful against fire attacks, which you will see against you pretty often.  Length of the game could be definitely higher, I've beaten all levels in 5 hours, considering I've been stuck for about 45 minutes at the final boss. The game offers 14 levels (and 4 bossfights) split into 4 locations. Worth mentioning is the third location, the amusement park. It just brings back the horror from Sonic 3's circus stage - but don't worry, only visually!  As you check negative reviews and discussion, you can see many posts about bugs and bad performance. I've played the game on four years old low-end laptop and had no problem getting 60 FPS. For the bugs, I've found the one that made many people uninstall the game - I couldn't move and when I jumped, I just got shot to the stars (into the place where even textures don't exist). But this was solved only with restarting the game, then it was okay. It surprises me what can happen with 'another platformer made in Unity engine', totally didn't expect that. One more thing, which I found half-baked, is the restart level function - it takes you a life! So... instead of restarting, you can just die, it's the same.   Conclusion:",1,0

Yeah, Amnesia was nice, but pretty poor executed, imho. I enjoyed it as P.J. Lovecraft fan, but that’s it. And I should say now: “Outlast is GREAT!” I can’t say that it frightened me much (four jump-scares caught me thou), but it gave me really unique disturbing, sick and gore feeling of horror happening all around for the whole 4 hours of gameplay. Outlast is short, but I really don’t regret about money spent on this game. It’s very nice, dark, bloody and solid interactive story to enjoy with great atmosphere of damned asylum.

234140,Mad Max,"If you've played and enjoyed the Arkham series and Shadow of Mordor, picking up Mad Max is pretty much a no brainer. It features the same close combat and upgrade system as the two other games.  The world and the visuals are extremely well crafted and provide the perfect Mad Max atmosphere. The game is mechanically very sound, which is no surprise considering the games it borrows elements from.  For actual criticism: the game gets very repetitive. If you're a completionist, you're going to spend dozens of hours looking for that last piece of scrap in a camp that bears an eerie similarity to another camp you visited ten minutes ago and beating basically the same 4-5 varieties of goons all over the place. There is SO MUCH to do in the game that I could easily see someone spending 100+ hours to loot every camp, finish all the races and so forth. Odds are though, unless you have superhuman persistence, you're gonna get burned out after completing half of the looting objectives and will just finish the story to be done with the game.  The close combat is not quite as satisfying or tight as in Arkham or Mordor, as the special moves are more generic and limited to things that counter a certain enemy type, such as Melee Reversal or Shield Shatter. If nothing else, it does make the game a touch more gritty and realistic. The countering mechanic is not quite as responsive and it is harder to read enemies. Getting hit doesn't reset your combo counter in Mad Max, so missing a counter is not a huge deal, but it takes away that certain satisfaction of getting a 'perfect combo'.  The story is great; however, it is sprinkled throughout the game rather unevenly. Of my 50+ hours of playtime, I'd estimate roughly 5 hours is actually advancing the story. It is mostly focused in the beginning and the end of the game, with only a few short missions placed here and there to keep you in the story and also gate your progress by tying up access to new zones and upgrades to beating the story mission. During the majority of the game the presence of the main villain is merely implied by the presence of his lackeys, and it was not until the last hour or so of the story that I felt reconnected to the events at the very beginning.  In short: +It's as close to Mad Max as a video game can get +Good Batman-style combat system +Vehicle combat provides a nice change of pace +Lots to do +Excellent visuals that lend to a great atmosphere  -Optional objectives are repetitive -Combat is not as responsive as in games it borrows from -Story gets a bit thin during the middle part of the game",1,0

388880,Oxenfree,"Simply one of the best narrative driven adventure games to date. My final video review is still in the works, but I don't want to delay this recommendation -- play Oxenfree. It is visually gorgeous, along with containing an absolutely fantastic sound scape of music and stellar sound design. It's writing is damn impressively well done and even puts some of Telltale's work to shame. The variety of choices, both big and small, is fantastic (even if there is a limit as far as different endings, due to the game's four hour length). Even the radio gameplay mechanic is surprisingly engaging.  My only real complaint is that the game's refusal to let you have manual control over your walking speed makes backtracking for collectibles a genuine chore. But those are really only there for three achievements and for some extra backstory, so it's not a huge loss if you ignore them or collect them all.  While I will agree that $20 seems a bit much for a game that can be beaten in four hours, considering I am already planning to play through at least two more times, the cost evens out, and you can also elect to get the game on sale (I waited until it hit $15).  Overall, it is a solid piece of work, and I look forward to what Night School has planned for their next title. Buy it, play it, and then play it again.",1,0

368360,60 Seconds!,"I've played 60 seconds for about 60 minutes so far and am liking it. No tutorial needed, very easy to pick up and start playing. It takes some elements from This war of mine, for example being forced to make choices for your survival or helping others who might help you later. It also has a similar depressing atmosphere, although the devs have added a good dose of humor into the mix.  You start out in your house with the alarms going off warning about an incoming nuclear attack. You have 60 seconds to run around, pick up some resources (including famil y members) and dump them into the shelter. You then hop into the shelter yourself and the real game starts. Every 'round' you have to make decisions on how to ration food and other supplies, send people out for a scavenging hunt, etc. you will be faced with a lot of obstacles and things will generally not go very well. At least they did not go well for me :)  pros : easy to pick up, humor cons : the initial stage of collecting resources is not very easy to control (a little messy)",1,0

Which will result in stuff flying or walking in your house. Which then scares the ♥♥♥♥ out of the guy who is supposed to help you, so what does he do you ask? HE OPENS THE OTHER DOOR TO RUN OUT OF THERE ASWELL! So trap that little f*cker......you get to have a little fun with him some time into the game don't worry &gt;:)  But serious, i've played it for quite a few hours. And I gotta say I love it! There's a ton of stuff to do (bosses, dungeons, missions etc) and the best part? You can easily host a server and have your friends join you!

You'll die a lot, but with each new descendant you'll be able to progress further and further in the castle and unlock/defeat the bosses. This game has an interesting gimmick in that you have no lives, you play until you get killed and your descendant continues, in another randomly generated castle. What's funny though (and humor is a huge part of this game) is that your descendants will have random genetic 'defects'. For example, your character can end up having IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) and will roam the castle endlessly passing gas. To cut this review short, I loved this game and I definitely recommend it, despite how frustrated it made me feel. 4/5",1,0

Maps in one area are not necessarily designed for the overall level of players in that area are. there are hidden dungeons and hidden quests inside this dungeons. You can take different paths to reach the same place. and it has fast travel. -Apparent non-linearity. The gam is quite linear, it has a series of quests you should follow and so on, but you can deviate from them, you can go to a dungeon and just kill monsters, you can skip almost all quests (not recommended) and this, along with exploration, makes this game feel non-linear. -IMC is actually listening tot he community and change mechanics based on wha the community says (premium items mostly). -IMC supports/allows some mods for this game.  CONS: -Bad management at the first days/weeks -Game was crowded the first days and it was very laggy. -Poor optimization. although this game would run on basic hardware, specialized hardware cant do much more with it (same fps). -In game currency obtained with real money underwent a change and is mostly very expensive in non-US countries. -Sometimes you should grind a lot (A LOT)  Overall: Recommended game if you like MMORPGS that are not WOW clones.",1,0

262410,World of Guns: Gun Disassembly,"World of Guns: Gun Disassembly has to be a very interesting and informative game around our world of guns. It shows you everything you need to know about a weapon in particular from field stirpping to complete disassembly of the weapon in particular.  The controls for the game once you start can be a little tricky but once you get a hold of them it's easy. You start off with an AK-47 and the tutorial teaches you the basics, once you've completed the turtorial you then start to unlock new games for each weapon and earn points to spend on unlocking new weapons that branch out in different directions of your choice.  This leads me to my only slightly negative point I can find about the game so far, the points required to unlock some weapons or a firing range can be a bit ridiculous in cost and can lead the game to being tedious at times and frustrating to those who don't play the game a lot or will find time to dedicate themselves to the disassembly and reassembly of each individual weapon that being said, practice makes perfect; right? However if you have a credit card or bank card and you're not afraid to throw some cash at the producers to unlock the next level; you can do just that.  The game also includes an extension on 'Disassebly' and goes as far into the human skeleton, animal skeletons, dionsaur skeletons, cars, motorcycles, and many more. However most of these you must also purchase.  Overall I believe the game to be highly repetitive but also informative and on a certain level; highly educational on not only weapons but body parts, cars, motorcycles and many more.  8.5/10",1,0

475490,Major\Minor,"I can't... I just can't...   This game, there's no words to describe it. It's bad, awful, a vile piece of work developed by one man who seems to have used an Engine ('RPG MAKER') for a Visual Novel and did not even program it correctly to act along the Visual Novel setting.   From save game bugs to the most basic spelling errors that even a 2nd grader can spot - I just can't.   If you're a furry, like me, who enjoys the art of writing and this game seems interesting to you I have to tell you one thing buddy... Don't waste your money, save it, better yet give it to charity.  Aside from my mindless rambling about how bad this game is I'd like to name this game the  'No Mann Sky of Visual Furry Novels' , a title it truly deserves.    The Story:  The plot is really bad, like really. The 2016 Election would make for a better plot for a visual novel than this game; Your character is so lackluster - It feels like your playing a mindless zombie and it's worse than a telltale game, your choices don't really matter unless you want the ending which is defined as 'good'.    The game tries to reeeaaaallly push out 'morality' in your face by giving you a bunch of moral questions throughout it, Are these moral questions good? No, they can be answered by a kid with a capable mind.    The characters are either boring, dull or plain stupid - I'd love to name names but I know the history of how reviews here get flagged, so I'll be good and abide by the Rules &amp; Guidelines.    Anyways, the story is set in some sort of hyper-dimensional time wish washy thingo mingo let's all go to bingo; It's extremely saddening to see.    Throughout the story you'll be able to experience the Developer's inner mindset by seeing and noticing what books, video games or political thoughts he might have had throughout the making of this game - Which keep in mind just makes this game a bunch of other 'things' combined up to this monstrosity.    The game is set up in Japan, but everyone speaks English and everything IS English (just a silly note).   If you're here for the 'novelization' of an epic, choice-thrilling quest of adventure then you came to the wrong place buddy.    The Visualization:  Oh, the Art style is fine, it's terrific actually - the one bit I'll give the game a plus in. But that's still like 1/10 lads.  The characters don't have emotions, sometimes when they are supposedly sad they still use the 'preset' face and look happy as heck, or dull - Which takes the emotional part of visual novels away, How is this a visual novel if their emotions are not visualized?  Surprisingly the Developer and another character you meet in the game (Yes, the developer is IN the game) are the only two characters with multiple expressions... Yep.    The Sound:   From what I can enquire the game uses preset soundtracks and even if it doesn't, It's still bad sound.   You'll need your own soundtrack to play through this mess, believe me.    Programming &amp; Code:  The game runs on RPG Maker; An engine made for RPG games, not visual novels - I mean, it can be used for Visual Novels, it's not like it can't but still... The Developer didn't even remove some parts of the Engine that still exist... Pressing enter is the only way to save the game when you get a chance to do that and even then, Saving doesn't always work (so save multiple times).   It feels really boring when your game crashes, you can't save or when some sort of weird bug happens - It destroys the game, but the plot already did.    Anything Else:  There are SEVERAL characters missing from the game - Once more I can name them but I choose not to for the safety of my steam account lads; It seems that they were removed from the game by a personal dispute with the Developer.    Most characters are those of backers who've donated a fair sum of money to the game and or are friends of the Developer - some of these people have reaaally weird stuff on the backend of things...    Also, It appears no girls have backed this game as all the female's within this game are OC's and they are HEAVILY stereotyped females... - Everyone in the game is either a masculine man, or a feminine boy, or a female stereotype.    I feel sorry for anyone who has donated for this game, I feel sorry for the Developer who had to go through the trouble of making this mess and I feel sorry for anyone who has bought it... I just do.      In three short word's I'll describe this game to you   'Bland, disappointing and sad'  - It had potential, It had potential... If only where the criticism of this game picked up by the Developer instead of pulling out a George Lucas on us all.    If you're still thinking of buying this game after my review, or would like me to answer you some questions - Please, feel free to add me and take a moment of your time to think for yourself if you really want to buy this... In the end of the day, it's YOUR investment.    [Alongside this review will be published a video review in the upcoming months, so be prepared my fellow gamers and writers]",-1,1
288120,Dungeonmans,"I don't really understand why this is reviewed so well. It's really not a well-designed rogue-lite.  So, what is dungeonmans? It's a rogue(lite) game in which you pick a character, customize some of it's stats and perks, select a class (optional) and off you go to slay random monsters around the randomly generated world. Or die horribly.  What is different from most roguelike games is, that unlike most roguelikes where after you die you roll a completely fresh character, is that you can eventually upgrade your starting characters with various perks by bringing back various items to the starting zone: base stats, better starting gear, you can even unlock entire skill trees from the get-go.  However, this is where the core issue lies. The game balance is designed with this in mind. You will need to essentially farm stats for your future character to succeed. Otherwise you will literally get one shoted by higher tier monsters. And there is no way of working around it. The hordes of enemies and the lack of complex spells and abilities waters down the gameplay to 'grind stats, die, start another characters, repeat' until you EVENTUALLY get strong enough to walk over everyone' faces.  The 'randomly generated' dungeons are very repetitive with no interesting objects to interact with. The loot is tiered, meaning as soon as you get an item from a higher tier the other ones become obsolete. The skill 'trees' are a sad joke.  Overall, not a good game, not even as a 'babbys first roguelike'.",-1,1

367670,Controller Companion,"Wow! This program is great. It's the kind of program that you'll wonder why you haven't been using all along. If you output to a TV or projector for gaming, you won't be able to live without this after using it.  PROS:  This lets your XBox 360 controller function as a mouse/keyboard, and is programmable enough to change the buttons to other functions. A great feature is the fact that the developer used the 'Back' key toggle a seperate set of functionality for your controller. Very well executed! And the price...you will feel like you got it on sale even at 'full price.' (Just $3...Buy it!) This is a must buy if you have a controller. Oh...and a really cool feature: You can turn off your Wireless XBox 360 controller without having take out your batteries! Just Use the XBox button and Back. Why didn't Microsoft add this to their software? Who knows.  UPDATE: The developer has added support for the XBox Chatpad. I bought one after I saw the update, and it is amazing. Granted he added a way to input keys with just the controller, but the homegrown chatpad support makes this awesome program so incredibly useful that it's mind boggling.  Side Comment: It's kind of a shame that Steam doesn't have this amazing functionality built in! Come on Valve...get with it.   EDIT:  I used to have one 'con' listed , since it used to show itself as a primary App/Game when you're online and would not let your Steam messenger change your status to 'Away' or 'Snooze' and would say 'In-App Controller Companion'... but they fixed that!  Now it doesn't even show as running in Steam. Wonderful!!!  Another good thing with the recent fixes is that it no longer counts towards 'hours played' on Steam, so it won't become your 'most played game' or make it look like you played games for days straight. Nice work developers!   VERDICT: An absolute MUST BUY!",1,1

This quest relly brought to by heart of what it does feel to be a sufferer or depression. Most games offer a point gaining empathy on the issue showing that lack of anceny a suffer has. Do the right think will make you feel better. That is EXACTLY the point od depression. That is the illness in and of itself. 'Go out and have a good timme and it'll make you better.' 'Why could Robin Williams and like so.... So look at those that love them, how could they do this on you.' The real question of depression has been amplified with since of crying. Remore perhaps but not sadness, not happiness not an extreme in away ways form..The best analogy is I come to you with my fishes are dead... 'Oh maybe, they're just asleep' No they're dead. 'But my fish are dead' Maybe we could put them back in the tank and they'll be alive again... 'WHY CAN'T ANYONE SEE MY FISH ARE DEAD?'   This game, it not only shows the dark path that an emotionless person walks truly. I can't find happiness or remorse of at least what my mind remember them at. You equate depression as merely a lack of optimism or a lack of choice. You'll go out and have fun but this silly say phase you're in will just vanish' And that 'Happiness inventure or shoubles on top of the feeliong of I know this is fun but I have no feeling of what fun is and I further pull away into myself. And as you pull awa y 'fun' things, your friends pull away as they find you no longer fun too.  So you're alone in your bottle and all you want is to stop the nothingness. Fime with your family and closest arrange you drain you because whats the points is tasks when theyre munedane and spar not even the slightest sparkk of 'fun'.  When yout find fun, even though you new what they used to be, a vague sliver in the dark, they're the light at the end of the tunnel.but the tunnel is no light ahead. Some are lucky that eventually light leads to this tunnels end and what's next?  I don't want to stay in the dark.... I'be been here for so long.

293180,Overcast - Walden and the Werewolf,"SO.. Where do I start? I had to make a transaction to sell some uneeded stuff over the steam marketplace so I literally looked for the cheapest game that I thought I may could put up with one day and found Overcast - Walden and the werewolf for $0.14..   Overcast - Walden and the werewolf is a physiological horror game that eats at you with the erie atmosphere not knowing when, where, or what may pop out. In between every chapter you get cinematic cutscenes that fill in the story piece by piece. The cutscenes have heroic music behind them and subtitles telling the story. You have 9 chapters of story to complete which can be completely within a couple of hours at most.  This is a FPS. In the left hand you have a lantern, the right you have your handy rifle. You only get one gun. One bullet and then you have to reload everytime. Only a couple of keys to control the whole game while having the 'hand' cursor the same as Penumbra or Amnesia games to grab and move objects around.   While being a huge horror movie and game fan I adore this game for what it tries to do. The graphics are dated and are not pretty as the games today but Overcast proves you can still scare the sh*t out of people without modern graphics. Now for graphics this games graphics are pretty plain. Very grainy style graphics that makes it hard to see anywhere far from you. BUT. I've seen people get scared and jump at a lot less than this. But there are a couple of times in the game that I can imagine some people may get freaked out or even jump at.  Gameplay was pretty smooth for me but I did encounter a bug two times during the final boss fight that I guess kept the fight going and somehow I randomly died both times? After one final attempt before shutting the game off for the night, randomly with me expecting more fight the game ended!  The combat in the game was very boring in my opinion. It gives you a gun that has one shot, takes forever to reload and makes you back up - shoot - reload during every fight. I can understand that this machinism is designed to implant fear or panic but in my case it just annoyed me to no end making things feel very drawn out.  I was not a big fan of the story, but to me it was more of a game with a 'base' story that thrown me in the game to play. The heroic music in each cinematic cutscene made me feel like a badass and even in some combat the music gave me hope!  Bottom line: For under a dollar if you are a horror fan looking for something to occupy your time for a couple hours, maybe give you a couple jump scares than pick this up. I do recommend this game because besides the final fight I had no problems running or playing this game. It has a story, it was in 3d, and could get a couple good jumps out of some people. That is my $0.14 cents worth people :)",1,1

275850,No Man's Sky,"Apparently I'm part of the 2% who can actually run this game, so I might as well say something that's not about crashes.  I'm having fun.  True, for the most part it's about digging up resources, but before you can put them to use you need to get blueprints for new tech. And that's the fun part. Trekking, or better yet, flying over the planet's surfaces, looking for points of interest such as alien artifacts or alien inhabitants in need of help. I like how you are not a linguistic master right off the bat, but have to learn single words of an alien language, then try to understand what they say from what translated bits you have. It feels rather organic, or as much as it can be, realistic.  From the way alien sites, outposts and artifacts are scattered around I got some pleasant Mass Effect 1 vibes from it in terms of planetary exploration. Just instead of a Mako you got a jetpack.  It's foolish to believe this game could live up to the expections people had for it. Most games don't. But as I said I'm having fun so you might, too. Although you might wanna wait for the next sale. 60 quid is a bit much for it.",1,0

19680,Alice: Madness Returns,"Terrible.  1. TERRIBLE CODING EFFICIENCY My gaming rig can play Alan Wake without any slowdown in performance. This game has despite that fact. It is obvious that the coding of Alice: Madness Returns is NOT optimized.  Horrible performance when enemies are attacking you. It gets worse when you kill them and they ooze out. That oozing graphics is a performance killer.   2. I CAN BARELY FEEL THE GRIMDARKNESS Its more action than anything else. Think Darksiders 1 or 2, except this one has a mad teenage girl with a vorpul kitchen knife, and performance issues.  UPDATE#2: Now that I have improved performance, I can now feel the grimdarkness of this game. I must say - nice...real nice. It helps me develop my own rendition of a certain background character whose concept has been...'made up' and 'accepted' by fans of a 'certain' cartoon franchise.  3. CONCLUSION The thing that kills it is the performance issues. Mind you I have graphics settings down. Way down. Still lags.   UPDATE#1: To improve performace, the first thing I did was to put PHYSIX on low. I'm using an ATI card so I don't care much about PHYSX. Wish I could turn it off completely.  Google the issue on how to improve performance with this game. There's lots of articles online about it.",1,0

252630,Eldritch,"When I first saw this on Steam Greenlight, I was both interested and skeptical. Interested because of the concept, and skeptical because it looked kinda meh. When it did have a Steam release, I decided to wait until it was on sale, and boy was it a mistake.   Let me get the only good thing out of the way first. Eldritch has a wonderful concept. An FPS with rogue-like elements mixed in with some Lovecraftian lore sounds like a great idea. Scratch that, it IS a great idea. But sadly, as mentioned before, this is the only standout feature of the game, as the rest of the game is pure mediocrity. I would like to start off with the gameplay. You start off in a library, which is a base of operations of sorts. Here, you can take out or put in currency that you have obtained throughout the game, enter into levels (of which there are only three, plus that one level introduced in the free expansion pack), and cuztomize the look of your character (you can actually make yout character look like the god of rock and roll frontmen, Freddie Mercury, but this doesn't change the fact that the gameplay sucks). After you enter the level you wish to enter, you are put in a randomly made dungeon, and that is where the ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan. The game is so stupidly easy, and it feels like the game was designed for kiddies who have never played an FPS, as you can only wield two weapons at once, and you can only have one magic spell at a time. The AI isn't any better, as it is dumb as bricks. Currency in the game is used for two things, and that is to buy ♥♥♥♥ and to use magic spells, which is sadly the only other standout feature found in this game. The rogue elements are minimal. In fact, the only rogue part about the game are the randomized levels. Everything else is just look for the items and drink at wells to increase your HP. The FPS gameplay in the end feels generic and lame as ♥♥♥♥, and the rogue elements do not help to stir things up.   Graphically, the game looks like ♥♥♥♥, as it wants to look like an NES game, following that one ♥♥♥♥♥♥ trend in indie games that needs to ♥♥♥♥ing die. Now, you would think that because its graphics are ♥♥♥♥, the framerate would be fine. Instead, you have some very noticable lag in windowed mode, and it is even more noticable in fullscreen mode. This shows that the game is poorly coded and has optimization issues. Overall, not worth your money. You would probably have more fun playing a full rogue-like game.",-1,0

I love games the build atmosphere and this game does a good job of that. I would call this an alternate horror game as it definitely doesn’t not share game play styles with other games in it’s genre. The biggest let down for me with The Park is that to really find out the deeper back story around the park, rather than the main story about a missing child, you have to go play The Secret World. This makes me feel like I paid for a playable advertisement for a MMO I have no interest in playing. I would still recommend the park based on it’s sound design and some of the clever use of storytelling it has. I would also recommend examining everything you can find. It is really easy to pass over small things to examine that can add greatly to the plot. Also buy it when it is on sale, and I did and I think if I had bought it at full price I would have been disappointed.",1,0

243120,NA,"This is a bit of a tough one seeing as I know some won't enjoy this style of game. Betrayer is a mystery solving, partially open world adventure game with FPS and horror elements. It takes place in the early 1600's right after the North American New World begins to be settled by European Powers.  To start off, those looking for an all action FPS single-player game may be disappointed to find the action here is a lot slower then you may like because of authenticity to the era. Combat makes up roughly ~40% of the game, solving mysteries and the main story makes up another ~40% and the final ~20% goes to free-roaming adventure, finding chests, places to dig, etc...  The games high points are the environment and atmosphere are which both unique in usage and awesome for keeping true to the time period. The story progression is smooth and interesting (provided you read the text) and the difficulty in combat ramps up fairly as new enemies and weapons are introduced. Though some find the game to be repetitive, each area had enough to explore and complete to keep me occupied and remain interested throughout. Overall, I recommend this game for those seeking a unique experience filled with murder and mystery.  Optional: If you are an achievement hunter most of the achievements are easy enough to be done without the use of guides (as long as you pick up everything and complete the whole story) although you will certainly need a 2nd play-through to grind enough enemies for the killing achievements (I farmed the Fort Hope conquistador part for kills but there are other spots too).",1,0

The only weird thing is, it's not a normal FPS. You control everything about the gun. From the slide, to a slide lock, you can even put it on safety. However, that doesnt mean all these cool mechanics mean this game is flawless. The story, from what I've seen, is non-existant in the beginning. You need to progress through the RNG-based world to get more and more of the lore. That... makes me feel weird. I want to know what I'm supposed to do. Just dropping me off in a room/hallway/on a rooftop with no explanation doesnt really grip me. That's my only gripe with the game. It is really, really fun to just siut down and play for like 10 or 20 minutes, or in my case, 2 hours. You should get it, but do like I did, and get it while it's cheap.

523730,Sweet Volley High,"Warning : If you do get the content restoration patch, I  strongly  advise using headphones. The voice actors in this one are... alarmingly talented.  This visual novel seems to break all the rules for VNs here on Steam.   It has a very solid story with multiple themes: love, death, betrayal, depending on your choices.   It was written by someone whose native language is English.   It is almost entirely devoid of typos, grammatical gaffes, plot holes, and in-story contradictions.   There are only four decision points, relatively late in the game, which select between the five very different end points quite simply and clearly. There are no pointless decisions to make.   While there are sex scenes (if you have the patch), they are organic to the story; they're not grafted in for faptastic effect.   If you want a story with clothing magically falling off the female characters, or harems, go elsewhere. What you'll get in this story is believable characters, some you'll like, some you'll probably hate, in a story that holds your attention. Your main character is Aya, a high-school junior, who is suddenly dragged off the bench of her volleyball club when one of the two star players of the team is injured. The story follows her through her senior year and into the beginning of her life past graduation. How that life unfolds, happily or otherwise, depends on the choices you make.  The story is partially voiced; voicing is used for the lines that are emotionally most freighted. The dev was, in my opinion, extremely apt in his choices of vocal talent. My only complaint there is that he did not choose to voice the viewpoint character.  Play time: approximately four to five hours for all five endings.  Full disclosure: As an independent tester for this title, I was involved in rather a lot of its development, from first script right up to release. I am not an employee of, or contractor for, New West Games and have no financial interest in this project.",1,0

241540,State of Decay,"This game is worth the money. Its way more indepth than I was expecting. At first it can be overwelming at the responsbility and figuring out how to manage everything, but you catch on pretty quick. I recommend reading the 'how to play' before starting. I know I don't have many logged hours, but I play mostly offline and it didn't log those hours for some reason. I like how you have to do thing to build up your reputation (influence) to use things from the storage and make decisions about how to upgrade your base. From what I've played, everything seems to run great. However, the controls do get a little clunky at times, but nothing bad enough to be upset. I'm also playing with keyboard and mouse, this game is an XBLA game so a control would probably work better. My only real complaint is if this is a 'simulation', why are you the only one able to carry thing on supply runs? You can take people with you on the runs but they don't pick up anything?? If it is a person you can switch to, you drop the bag when you switch. You can't put the bag in your vehicle and get another either. I'm just very picky about details.

262190,Zombeer,"Let me start by saying I managed to stomach a complete play though. So I have seen the entire game, with that said this game is pretty bad. However there are three things I feel people should know about before even considering this game.  THERES NO ENDING!  This seriously ticks me off! The game literally has no ending it just cuts off. The game even goes as far as to tell you they ran out of funs while your playing the game. but guess what? NO WHERE on the store page does it tell me this game is unfinished…  Poor Controls Controller buttons are not labeled properly during gameplay. Why is this a problem? Because this game had the wonderful idea of adding parts to the game where you must hit the proper buttons Quickly in the right order at certain parts or die instantly in most cases. Telling me to hit joystick 1 for X button then expecting me to do it within 1 second is annoying, even more so when there are very high penalties for messing up, (usually death). Another issue with controls that if you plan on using a controller be ready to feel frustrated   Drink or die  Yep you must constantly drink if you forget to or run out you will get game over. I should note there is plenty of beer throughout the entire game and you should almost never run out. So why is it a issue? It drains FAST and becomes annoying while you are in combat plan and simple. Having to worry about the gauge while I’m trying to focus on fighting (which is pretty low grade as well) is tedious.   Bottom line I wish the DEVS spent less time and money on developing breast physics, and more time actually finishing or fine tuning a game. at any rate if a game with no ending, and unpolished gameplay is a problem for you stay clear.  P.S. I will note I was harsher due to there being no ending(and no warning about it..) if the devs go back and add one I will update my review but there are many other issues to be address to, The down side is the idea seemed interesting it was just executed poorly.",-1,1

Usually you would think, timing your dodge perfectly with the enemy attack gives you bonus damage or something.

372770,Floors of Discomfort,"It would be easy to write off Floors of Discomfort (FoD) within the first few minutes of game play, as I almost did (my first thought: 'This feels like it belongs on Kongregate.'). That would be unfair though, because there really is more to it than first meets the eye.  The Overview: FoD is a platformer only inasmuch as you walk left or right killing things, and occasionally jump. That's it, really. The challenge comes with the sheer numbers of enemies thrown at you from the very start. For example, you can enter a new game and literally be overwhelmed with mobs in a matter of seconds (including one beastie who opens a portal through which other beasties can come). The more you play, however, the more you realize that some strategy is necessary to ensure your survival. Running away from (or jumping over) mobs is a viable option. Some mobs (and crates strewn about the levels) drop coins, which can be used in an in-game store to purchase power-ups. Treasure chests also might provide help (pray for the Speed Boost). The longer you survive, the more powerful you can become, but proper management of your extremely limited money is essential. The 'Rogue-lite' aspects of the game refer to the random item and mob placement, the platform surface (although it might as well be designed, as it doesn't feel any different from one game to the next) and sorta-kinda permadeath.  The Finer Points: The first thing I usually do in an Indie game is to turn off the music, but it's actually above par here; I enjoyed the combination of atmospheric/dub/pop present in FoD (it also played continuously for me, but there is at least one report of it playing intermittently). The power-ups are also creative and fun. The character models are interesting to look at, and the hand-drawn art can be charming; at its best, it's reminiscent of The Binding of Isaac. I love the look of the shop, for example, although in higher resolutions (which cap out at 1600x900) items float above the shelves they should be resting on. Unfortunately, the rest of the play field (such as the background and platform surface) is dull and uninspired, and the tiled patterns used don't gel with the hand-drawn art, bringing down the overall look of the game. The character animations are fairly fluid, though.   A couple of other things to consider: The controls cannot be remapped, and gamepads don't seem to be implemented which, in a platformer, seems a bit of an oversight. Finally, there is only one character unlocked at the start of the game, which means no choice for the player (a rarity in 'Rogue-like' games).  Things I'd like to see in a patch: Steam overlay integration. Trading cards and (especially) achievements; in a game this difficult, with this few player options, achievements would go a long way to making it feel worth playing. I'd also like to see a crouch option, but I suspect the entire enemy is hitboxed, and not just the weapon it uses. Another character option at the start of the game would be great, too; make the rest unlockable. Different heights and gaps in the platform would definitely increase replay value, although I'm sure that would involved re-coding enemy AI as well as the play field, so I wouldn't really expect it.  All that said, however, the game is pretty much complete, and I enjoyed it once I realized it was deeper than it first appeared. It's something to pick up and play for short bursts when you want to beat the crap out of things and push yourself to do better 'just one more time.' It's priced about a buck too high, but FoD is simple and fun, and, at its current price of $5.99, less than the cost of a matinee ticket. Recommended.",1,0

214490,Alien: Isolation,"Alien: Isolation, was a lot of fun and great survivalist experiance. You do get to take it to the bad guys a bit but for the most part this game is about staying alive and accomplishing your objectives while avoiding being detected, much like the movies.    I really enjoyed this new alien game certainly a step in the right direction for the IP. Some people complain about the alien always being near, being too fast, killing you if you run or being able to hide from it by crouching and walking around a table. I find that if you play the game the way Ripley, would be acting in that situation in the movie, you do just fine. In areas where I just knew the ailen would be all over it was not but one wrong move and it was there in a split second. If I took off running because I was getting impatient, there it was, I would have to hide and wait for it to clear out before continuing. Running comes in handy when they are far away, at the end of a hall for example, it will help you to break line of sight and get in a locker or under a table. Then you have to wait a bit before they lose interest. As for hiding behind tables and other things I can see the gripe, but in the situations these folks are talking about I could see someone smashing flat up against the back of a booth as tight as you can to minimize what can be seen. So accurate tactic in my opinion but not executed perfect visually here.       The graphics and environment are spot on with what you would expect from Alien. Audio right there with the visuals keeping you on the edge of your seat.     Plays alot like Dead Space, only Alien themed, with the mindset on stealth.

48240,Anno 2070,"This game is definitely a change of pace from the normal Sims City style games. Instead of waiting for everything to slowly happen, and not doing much, this game requires a lot of attention. Your main job is to build up your city, but you need to keep up with the food, drink, and entertainment needs of your people. As you're helping your people, you then need to begin building up defences, and a strong military to be able to defend yourself during wars that you initiate, or pirates (if you have them turned on).  A lot of people complain about DRM, but it isn't that big of a problem. You are able to play offline, but it just takes a minute or two longer to boot up. The 'DRM' portion of the game is such that: you must be connected to the internet to vote for the ingame Senate, and World Council...which affects all players so that makes sense. There are also a few missions that require internet access as they change daily. Just download the origional update, and once the game boots up, vote for the Senate, and Concil for the first time, and close the game...Boom, you may now play offline as much as you want.  I would recomend buying the Complete Edition as the mini add-ons, and Deep Ocean add a whole new amazing part to an already amazing game. I would recomend that if you have Deep Ocean with the game that you download the 'Anno 2170 ARRC Mod' as it will add so much to the game that gives you much deeper gameplay, and adds a lot of useful items that change the way the game needs to be played by making some things a bit easier, and some a bit harder.",1,0

206440,To the Moon,"Absolutely phenomenal game.  Overview: 2 partners work for a company that gives people wishes before they die. They go into thier memories and alter them in order to give the person what they want. It has an amazing love story in it.  The soundtrack is amazing, and it alone can almost bring me to tears after playing this game.  You can judge the graphics yourself based on the images, but I personally loved them.  The game is 100% story. There is no action of any sort in it. And that is 100% okay because the story is incredible. It brought me to tears.  Also, there is quite a bit of humor in the game. To be completely honest, I found that it was put into places where it shouldn't be, where it took away from the emotion of the story. But other than that, it was funny,  NOTE: The combat picture shown is part of a joke in the game. There is ZERO combat in the game. Once again, this is absolutely fine with me, just want to warn you if that is what you are looking for.",1,0

Also that unless you have some of the DLC (Which I recommend buying in sales instead of paying incredibly high prices) the game doesn't really feel complete.  9.5/10",1,0

218620,PAYDAY 2,"I've played my fair share of this game and i can say that i thoroughly regret actually buying this game. Now the game itself had some pretty great potential and i definetly had a lot of fun playing, but it had some pretty big problems since the beginning. In the beginning there were extremely few heists, most of which were just copies of the same bank robbery. I could have lived with that however. I had hoped for more but i would have accepted the little content there was and i would have appreciated for what it is. What i cant accept however is Overkills DLC policy. Sadly DLC has become a huge part of modern games, but Overkill truly takes it to the next level. At the moment there is DLC worth somewhere around 110€ in the game, most of it being guns or gun attachements, but there are also quite a lot of heists hidden behind a paywall. Now i'm sure a lot of people are screaming at the screen right now trying to convince themselves that the DLC is completely optional, that however is only half true. Because what is a heisting game without the heists? You're not going to enjoy this game too much with only the basegame heists and the free updates that come along every year or so dont really add that much gameplay either. Now aside from the DLC, they added another feature to the game, which basically gives you gun skins which gives you a bonus to your stats. These gun skins can only be optained from saves which can only be opened with drills that you have to buy with real money. This cs:go esqué pay2win update has been the last straw for me. Overkill tries to squeeze the most they can out of the customer with the least amount of work possible. A big amount of content they have added to the game over time, actually came from the modders in the payday community. Overkill literally copies their code and charges you for it. And if you ever try to criticise them on the steam forum you can expect your posts to be removed instantly and you may even be banned. So, should you give your money to Overkill? No. Not even if the game is on a 90% sale. Dont support these terrible devs and this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.",-1,0

341020,Chronicles of Teddy,"Excellent metroidvania platformer. Honestly one of the best platformers I have played in years. They really don't make them like this anymore, great level design, interesting and fun game mechanics, tight controls (your skill and timing are the only thing to blame for your failure), good soundtrack, lots of secrets. I put this game on the same level of enjoyment as 'Ori and the Blind Forest'. The aesthetics might not be the same, but this game is intentionally retro. Finding Teddy 2 does not hold your hand. Most of the progression through the game is left up to the player to figure out and find. Personally I enjoy this aspect. If you prefer to have your hand held and be told where to go every step of the way, then this title might not be for you. A gripe I keep reading about this game is the lack of maps. If you play the game past the first 15 minutes, you will discover that the game areas are separated in a way that it's ok that there aren't maps. The areas are not enormous, and they all have half-way portals between the main map and the boss dungeon in case you need to return to the main hub. If you enjoy exploration based metroidvania games with challenging (but not impossible) platforming, then I could not recommend this title more. I thoroughly enjoyed this game, played it exclusively until I beat it, and was terribly sad to see it end. To reiterate, they just don't make games like this anymore, and even fewer of this caliber. I hope this review helps anyone on the fence, thanks for reading.",1,0

214950,Total War: ROME II - Emperor Edition,"I think CA messup up BIG TIME with the launch of this game...but they are making amends. I have seen many many live streams of this game where players encounter rediculous bugs and glitches but things have changed over the months.   Before buying, I read so many negative reviews of this game and there are a lot. I didn't buy it at launch becuase of this. But now, after almost 10 patches, the game is receiving some nods. Thats why I took the plunge when the game was on sale and I don't at all regret my decision because this game is a worthy sequel to Rome I.   I started my TW journey with Empire and went on to play all the games and I'm having just as much fun with Rome II as with any other Total War. I haven't spent hundreds of hours on this game but I most certainly will because it has all the core mechanics that made TW fun. Grand battles with unique generals, citybuilding, exploration, politics, its all here and theres tons of DLC thats going to get pumped out over the years that will only make the game better.   Also, this is the hardest Total War game I have played yet. I cannot imagine why people are saying the AI sucks because it manages to kick my butt just like AI did in Shogun 2. I admit, I'm not that good at the game but the AI is challenging enough to make me want to refine my tactics.",1,0

218620,PAYDAY 2,"DON'T BUY. JUST PLAY THE DEMO A FEW DOZEN TIMES.  That will give you the entirety of the Payday 2 experience without wasting your money.  On the surface, this game looks well enough. The environment, people, and guns look (and sound) realistic enough and playing with friends gives an interesting experience in cooperation that's reminiscent of Left 4 Dead, but beyond that the actual gameplay mechanics, lack of scenarios, and level up/loot treadmill makes this game a repetitive chore after you've played through all the maps the first few times.  The missions themselves and the progression mechanics in this game are only there to waste your time. You will end up playing the same two or three unimaginative maps which involve holding out for 15 minutes until you can grab the McGuffin and beat the stage. Even then, you may randomly encounter an in-between timewaster escape mission which provides no extra reward and is just there to make sure you don't collect your payday too quickly. At each Payday, you also get a chance of a random weapon mod, mask, mask pattern, mask color, or money boost. This means if you want to get a mod for a certain gun, you need to play missions over and over until, BY CHANCE, you get the modification you desire in this completely arbitrary loot system. Even leveling up is set with road blocks, as you can't even place skill points without using your payday money. On top of having to buy expensive guns, with expensive mods with completely inflated prices, it all presents itself as a complete grind for no other reason than to slow your progression and distract you from the fact there is no extra, interesting game content past level 20. The missions play mostly the same, whether you're level 1 or 100, and the journey in between is complete filler.  TL;DR The game itself is incomplete and is just a skinnerbox for levels and gun mods. While the guns look and sound nice and on the surface it seems like a neat concept they only planned out enough maps to be interesting to about level 20 or so then you'll just be repeating the same Rats map ad infinite for MAYBE the chance to get that upgrade for that gun you want.  Also compared to Payday 1, the missions to do are so bland and boring it makes you wonder why the payday gang got together again after airlifting whole safe rooms or releasing the Left4Dead virus to rob a corner grocery eight billion times.

205100,Dishonored,"Dishonored  Atmosphere and world: Dishonoreds world is in the city of Dunwall a city infested with plague carrying rats that can eat a corpse in under a minute, you can explore places form the sewers to a rich familys masked party (actually a mission). The atmosphere is very dark (literally dark even in the daytime levels its pretty dark) with body bags filling the streets homeless people and weepers which are what the diseased become they're basically zombies.  Characters: Dishonored has loads of interesting characters (who you can learn about by reading theyre journals, notes, and listening to they're audiographs) from Piero the genius perv as I call him who spies on peopel whilst they bathe and makes all your weapons and gear, to Daud the assassin who murdered the empress and lives in the citys flooded district where they send all the dead bodys and diseased!  Story: You play as Corvo Attano the bodyguard of the recently deceased empress can you guess who really killed her.... its a joke because I already mentioned him in the last paragraph, fter you escape prison with the help of soem loyalists you start enacting your revenge killing the allies of the lord regent or royal spymaster as he was called, who hired Daud whilst doing this you save your rumored daughter who is the heir to the throne after she was kidnapped when her mother died btw her names Emily shes like 10 soooo ya just putting that out there incase someone decides to make porn of her just dont people already have dont google it you'll be a pedophile  Gameplay: You choose how you want to play do you want to murder everything or move like a ghost never killing anyone you decide  Weapons: you got your sword, your crossbow that can burn people kill people and tranquilize people, your grenades, your sticky grenades, your springrazors (prximity mines that send out blades), your bullets, your explosive bullets and i think thats it  POWERS: throughout the game you will find runes that you can spend to get superpowers and abilitys like: Blink a short range not so teleport teleport, dark vision your x-ray vision, possesion nuff said, devouring swarm summon rats to eat people, windblast through a gust of wind, vitality extra hp, agility dubble jump, shadow kill corpses turn to ash, blood thirsty or something like that essentially the combo kills from arkham games the ones where you hit people enough then you do an instakill except this time its with kills not attacks, and bend time stop time!

There may be times when you have to act real quick and you mess it up, but I always could do the things I want to do and I never had a problem with controls. The challenges in the game are great as well. You probably can skip them, if they are too hard for you, but you'll miss 70% of the games content. I really like the possibility that you can just kill everybody head-on and get away with it, if you are fast enough. Or you can sneak all around, be never seen and (almost) kill nobody in the entire game. But by far the best way to do things seems to be by the use of fear. All in all it is unbelievable that I always felt the challenge and no frustration. I can really recommend this game and also his DLC, which adds some new features and commentary from the whole programmers team.",1,0

32370,STAR WARS™: Knights of the Old Republic™,"This game is incredible. While it is an old game (2003), with not very impressive graphics, it boasts an incredible story, with side quests at every turn. You begin on the Endar Spire, a Republic Star Ship, which has been taken over by Sith. You, and a Republic pilot Carth, are the only survivors. You crashland in your escape pod on the planet Taris. What I find incredible about this is that it has it's own original storyline. While it has details that are the same (like Wookies and over races) it adapts them to make you have an enjoyable time while playing. I would highly recommend this game to just about anyone! It is a fully singleplayer game, however it's sequel Knights of the Old Republic 2, does have a multiplayer mode. I've only played three hours, and haveb't gotten very far into the story. Just, buy it. It's only $3.00 in the winter sale. I can guarantee that you won't be disapointed (except when there is a supposed hacker attack on Steam, and you can't acess KOTOR.

331600,ONE PIECE PIRATE WARRIORS 3,Edit: I now have over 90 hours of play time for the game and I am only at 85% complete. Although all that I have left is to finish getting gold coins and break through a character.  So this game can easily keep you busy for a few weeks if you're a casual gamer.  I bought the game when it was on sale for $15 recently. Since Im a big One Piece fan obviously I like the game so ill just talk about the negatives of it.  1. There is a crash issue. Its happened about 3 times to me. Now I save the game and exit after completing a episode or 2 before continuing just to be safe and it hasnt happened since I started doing that.  2. They cut a lot out from the anime/manga. I know they couldnt put EVERYTHING into the game but there are some things that I wish were added.  3. Its easy to spam and win with certain characters and abilities. Not to mention Leveling is way too easy. My Luffy is at 43 when the current episode I am at is 30.  4. The normal price of $50 ($60 for Gold) probably isnt worth what you get. I am not that far into the game but I can tell if I paid that price I wouldnt be content.  So if you just cant live without One Piece then just get the game already. Otherwise wait for a sale.,1,0

65980,Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth,"Review: Sid Meier's Beyond Earth.   Its good, but honestly, I'm more than a little disappointed. So far I played 2 games, First to learn the control, second to actually play the game (large planet). I spent about a solid day on the second game, and I am closing in on victory conditions. I remember eating up a similar amount of time in Alpha Centauri and getting less than half as far. The fact that the game can be played so quickly is a disappointment.   The storyline is somewhere between weak-sause and non-existent. Again, Alpha Centauri, I remember a scientist that studied the native life forms there died when a city was taken and how she would occasionally appear in the rest of the story line. There was some story in BE (human alien hybrids, etc), but it did not grab me like the old one did.   Opening cut scene was awesome. Interior cut scenes are ok to weak. Again, AC's cut scenes were cooler. Plus there were quotes from classic and modern times mixed in with the futuristic quotes. BE only has futuristic quotes (at least, the ones I saw, maybe if I built different wonders).  Graphics are great. No complaints there. Controls are Civ V standard. Alien units are cool. I actually liked the fact that science was non-linear and there really is no way to research it all so you really do have to choose what to research and what not to.   All in all it is a fun game to play, but I can't help but feel that it could have been better. My opinion may increase after playing more, and choosing different sides, building different wonders, etc, But all in all, I'd recommend it for Civ lovers that also love SciFi. But I would recommend Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri more.",1,0

253710,theHunter Classic,"I have played this game casually for many many hours off steam, so that is why my time on here is low. I'll be brief about it, because I do love this game. THIS GAME SHOULD NOT BE CALLED A FREE TO PLAY GAME if looking at it from a free to play win game it is the most inarguably pay to win piece of crap that there ever was. You only have a single (decent) weapon to start with, and can only hunt two animals, on a reserve that has 5 other things you can't shoot at. You can only unlock ONE gun without paying real money, and even then it would take an ungodly ammount of time, along with licenses, ammo, ect. This game is not satisfying or entertaining at all without a membership, and if you DO get one, it has some of the best gunplay, graphics, and experience of any hunting game I've ever played. I highly reccomend this game for that reason, because i've spent many hours tracking game. TL;DR: Not reccomendable unless you spend money on it, great fun if you do.",1,0

It was so weird that kept me playing until the end (note, this is just season one with prologue, episode 1 &amp; 2, there isnt a proper ending in this season).   I have to say that i had issues to run this game, QTE weren't smooth, it's like if my computer was struggling hard to handle all the actions and i don't have a bad computer. I don't know why it's so heavy to run (even on lowest resolution). Also yeah, this is FULL of QTE scenes, if you don't like that, stay away. Overall i find it well made, no crash, or bugs... beside the optimization, it's a good game and some singular story that is worth to be played.   7/10 would have rated 1 point more if it was decently optimized. I'm looking forward for the season 2",1,1

402060,Californium,"This game is inspired by the life and work of sci-fi author Philip K. ♥♥♥♥, who lived a large part of his life in California and battled with drug abuse. Many of his stories were written based on experiences he had while under the influence of drugs. The events that inspired 'A scanner darkly' seem to be the main inpiration of this game, but other recurring themes from his work such as paranoia, humans being replaced by androids and the existence of parallel universes are also present. The gameplay exists mainly out of walking around the authors neighbourhood, talking to various people and finding hidden sigils that will open up portals to another dimension. The games plot revolves around the author having to deal with the loss of his daughter, his wife leaving him and he himself having writers block and being unable to produce any meaningfull written material. Though it is never clearly stated it is heavely implied that the author is under the influence of drugs. The art style is gorgeous with highly saturated colours and relatively low polygon environments. Each alternate universe you'll travel to features a unique art style and has it's own back story which you'll uncover as you talk to the characters you'll meet. The stories in the alternate universe are interconnected and relate to the problems the main character is facing. The plot of the game is somewhat hard to follow because of the mental state of the main character and a lot is left to the imagination of the player. It's certainly not a game for everyone, just like the movie 'A scanner darkly' won't appeal to everyone. I enjoyed the experience despite some minor bugs and glitches. The main bugs have been worked out by the developers (like the game not properly saving your progress in a chapter) and I haven't experienced anything game breaking. The most annoying problem I've experienced is that sometimes dialogue from some of the characters I've met, was interrupted and this caused me to miss some of it.",1,0

The dialouge itself is very realistic and the conversations between other characters flow, though the main character does tend to interrupt. The story is absolutely filled with mystery and every word is another hint, it's important to pay attention. The walking should seem like it'd get boring, but the conversations mixed in prevent that. The ending was pretty dissatisfying for me and left me wondering, not because it sucked or anything but the fact that   no matter what you do, the ending is never 'positive'. But I guess not every story has to have a happy ending  . I can't wait to play it again and uncover more and more.",1,0

In the light of Overkill’s Producer Almir saying back in 2013, “We’ve made it clear that PAYDAY 2 will have no micro-transactions whatsoever (shame on you if you thought otherwise!)” you can imagine how that would come back to bite them in their hiney.

233450,Prison Architect,"Very fun game. You have all the tools to find illegal items, to punish prisoners or to make them somewhat happy with all reabilitation programs. Nice and simple graphics, easy to install mods. Doesn't judge you if you haven't fully completed tutorial and went straight to sandbox, because it says to you whats wrong in prison and it's (most of the time) easy to find how to fix it and it gives you time to do so. It's not kind of those real time strategies when game says something is wrong and it's already too late to fix it, unless you're expert on it. Also, while playing I saw a lot of fun things happen, for example prisoner sleeping handcuffed near his pickaxe and he was smilling :D  So yeah, but there are also some flaws, for example on some places game feels unfinished, for example it's too little of explanations on buildings and things you can build, but there is a mod which brings all information from official wiki to the game and it doesn't feel like something is off. Also I spent like a few hours when I finally find out why my prisoners can't make beds, this wasn't written any in game, but I found it on official wiki (before installing mod). So you may stumble upon some things which feels not finished or smth, but overall this game is awesome simple indie realtime strategy.  One more thing, it's to expensive for it's price, so get it on sale. It's nothing new after like 10 hours of gameplay, so only thing that will make you play will be that you'll want to sell your prison and build another, bigger, greater, safer etc.",1,0

8190,Just Cause 2,"First of all i must say i would rather play mercenaries 2 again over this game! The reason is simple, for about the samething you can do, in a little different way, I like better the voices and the killing point is the long distance between missions, the loading if you decide to call a lift to there that is not that long, but long enough when you need to use this to not have to walk 30 mins to the next mission.  Graphics are very good and some mechanics can be fun to play with if you can play with some camera probs or glitches.  Since i dont want to take too long, I still recommended this game if it goes in special ( as it appear to happen a lot ) as it got Xbox controller support, and the controls are not bad. Great graphics for sure and its possible to have some fun if you dont think you gonna play something else than a Mercenaries themed meet Bionic Commando.  Would give it 7/10",1,0

Leveling up gear is simple you get stones for some sword you would like to upgrade and if you want to make it do Elemental damage like fire, lightning etc, you need to go find the gem and infuse it with your weapon.  Leveling up your character, simple you fight enemies and get souls when you have enough souls you go to the fire keeper and lvl up something you want like health or strenght  Co-op and pvp: this is simple to do you first need an ember and go to a summon sign to spawn a phantom or sun bro and they help you on your way to the boss and you can 3v1 the boss. for the pvp aspect of the game its sometimes fun and sometimes not so fun and why do i say that? well its because of the people that use estoc and dark sword and they make everyone rage.  So for any player that wants a challenge and some good fun I recommend this game for me its a 9.5/10",1,0

205950,Jet Set Radio,"One of my personal favorite games of all time. The controls are a bit clunky at first, but it's totally playable with a keyboard. Controller is nice if you've got one, but with some practice, it's really not that hard. I recommend starting out playing character with low graffiti levels though, so you can get used to how the graffiti works a bit better, and once you're comfortable, then move up to the higher-level graffiti characters.  **SPOILERS**  On a far less serious note, there must be zero crime in Tokyo-to for the police to send attack dogs, parachute squads, choppers, Capatin Insane-o with a gun, TANKS, and tear gas to deal with a bunch of kids... with, well, probably about eight thousand vandalism charges. And then there's the Golden Rhinos. How much money do they have? Choppers, jetpacks, all kinds of guns, flamethrowers, suicide bombers, a giant, flame-spewing golden rhino robot, and on top of all that, they have to pay their agents!

228400,ACE COMBAT™ ASSAULT HORIZON Enhanced Edition,"In short, a 7.5/10. PROS: Great graphics, classic Ace Combat fighter action and great mission scripting. CONS: Takes away from original Ace Combat style of gameplay (more 'Call of Duty' style, fast-paced action), plays better with controller.  I personally am a HUGE fan of the original Ace Combat series of video games. I have all of their games released for PS2, with '04: Shattered Skies' and '5: The Unsung War' being my favorites from Namco-Bandai's Project Aces team, but this game, in all respects was somewhat of a disappointment. Without a doubt, it's a very good and (to me) a recommendable game, it just lacks a bit where the old Ace Combat really shined.  The Ace Combat series in itself is very well-renowned as a combat flight simulator for the Playstation 2, and for many years, the Project Aces team were the best of the best on the market. No other video games at the time gave a more realistic sensation of combat flight. Assault Horizon really diverges from that original goal, however. As mentioned in another review, in this game, 'Ace Combat' really becomes 'Aerial Call of Duty'. The game takes away from the realistic feel of flying the plane to bring in more action-packed and fast-paced gameplay. Features such as Dog Fight MODE and the addition of helicopter and gunship missions definitely stray away from the original Ace Combat. Other fans of Ace Combat on console systems will also take note of how impaired gameplay can be without a controller (joysticks are easier, and without them. the 'free-viewing' mode allowing the player to look around the plane or cockpit becomes unusable).  But that is not to say it's a bad game. Mission scripting is as good as ever from the Project Aces team, and the visuals are without a doubt phenomenal. It's still an Ace Combat game. It's still very enjoyable.",1,0

238260,Pinball Arcade,"If you ever visited arcades in the 70's, 80's, or 90's, this game is a main line to the nostalgia pleasure spot of your brain. With over 50 tables (and counting), you'll likely never be bored. Beyond that, it's pinball! These aren't fantasy tables, these are loving recreations of machines you'd be hard pressed to find in the wild today. Are they perfect? No. Do they play the same as the real thing? Well there's a world of difference between playing something fully mechanical with all the randomness of real world physics, and that of a digital version. That being said, it will improve your pinball IQ, and many times it comes damn close to being just like the real thing.  A note on purchasing. Buy the seasons, as you are paying for 6 tables and getting 10. It's an even better deal for seasons 1 and 2. Yes, that might make the game seem expensive, but look at it more as if you are buying a new Madden every year, only the old seasons work side by side with the new. Seriously, $30 is not bad for a block of tables that will keep you busy for an entire year. Even better if you get 'em on sale!",1,0

22350,BRINK,One of the biggest let downs I have ever had. Do not buy this game if you expect something that has to do with jumping around doing parcour. This game is basically a bad comic-copy of a bad CoD game without any outstanding features. The single player is nothing else than the multiplayer with terrible AI. It's repetetive and not exciting. The customization is fine but it does not make the game any better. It's just no fun to play and I would not recommend buying this.,-1,0
386940,Ultimate Chicken Horse,"UPDATE: I tried playing this game drunk with some friends. It gets EVEN BETTER. 10/10 would do again. Even if I can't really remember that Saturday.  I finally had a chance to play this game with some friends and I can without a doubt say that this is the best multiplayer/party game I have seen in a while. My absolute favorite thing is that the game literally requires you to troll your friends and sometimes even yourself in order to win and sometimes to such a point that you can literally make the goal completely unreachable unless someone uses a bomb to blow up the blockade, which can then just be rebuilt by you or another player moments later. The gameplay is fast paced and doesn't take too long to finish a game and while the choice to play with friends online is fun I found that playing with total strangers is the best way to go since they are unpredicatable.  I definitely recommend checking this game out and seeing how much fun it is for yourself.  I made a gameplay video with some friends for anyone curious about gameplay. Feel free to hop around the video there isn't much in the way of spoilers:  Drunk playthrough: This was like the third game in a series of drinking games and so at this point we were pretty much gone. Needless to say this was probably the best idea we've ever had. I'm not condoning underage drinking but if you are of age, I'd say get some friends and see how long you can last ;P  I recorded us attempting to play. Two of us did okay but the other two well.. they died xD  gameplay for anyone curious:  drunk playthrough:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9EioE5Eos4   Sober playthrough:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMt1W-JaGMI",1,1

319320,Time Mysteries 3: The Final Enigma,"The Final Enigma; Artifex Mundi's last installment in the Time Mysteries Trilogy. As a pretty avid Hidden Object Gamer, I love Artifex Mundi and all their work. If you're familiar with them, you already know that many of their games share a similar engine and similar play styles. This usually makes it easy for one to write a review about, but Time Mysteries is a difficult series, one which I believe I may find myself split on with a  Mixed Rating   Time Mysteries is probably the single trilogy that seems to not get the positive ratings that Artifex games always get. I can tell particularly, several reasons why. It is hard for me to speak on this series, given that I have only played 75% of the way through of this particular game, which happens to be the last. Therefore, I didn't want to judge too quickly, but I've noticed these several things enough that I feel I can speak as to the pros and cons of  this  installment. I have sunk maybe an hour or two into it, which if you know Artifex Mundi, you know that their games are short, but never lacking in content that truely makes the game. Artifex Mundi is known for its' great puzzles, HOGs, and storylines. These are the issues that I find are excellent and poor points of The Final Enigma...   Pros:  - As always, beautiful scenery and great artwork - The time travel element of the game is great. Using the special time clock you have is almost like using the map in other Artifex games, but something about it is just different and fun! :D - The story is very solid - Dozens of areas in the game to go to, more so than past games - The cutscenes can be amazing (at some points. It seems that AM has possibly changed up their cutscene style??   Cons:  - The voice acting in AM games can be a bit corny, but we deal with this because we love AM! But, this game, barring the protagonist, has a fair amount of poor voice acting. - Sometimes, the voices can sound overdriven or not mixed so well. - The puzzles difficulty level vary rapidly. I've found extremely easy and difficult ones just as well. This is probably a game to play on the Expert mode. - The cutscenes can be poor (at a minimal level, only sometimes).    Verdict?     5/10   - Sorry Artifex, I love you, I really do. The Final Enigma wasn't all that I expected. the mixed and negative reviews made me think that they were people who just weren't that into HOGing or Artifex in general. Upon playing this game, I realized why the reception was so mixed.   The first Time Mysteries is about to be released on Steam (after a reconstruction process, this is why some of the first games from the AM trilogy are currently missing). Before I write this series off as a sub-par trilogy, I would like to play through the entire series. The second and third (this one) have often recieved a thumbs down or negative reviews. It is probably for the above reasons that I am truely split on this game. For the first time I actually do wish Steam had a 'Neutrul' Button. I  WILL  recommend this for the time being. Why? Because it has a bold, newer style to it. The way that you travel throughout time and space is very cool. Also, the concept of the entire game (and probably series) is an interesting one.    Give it a chance if you love Artifex Mundi or Hidden Object Gaming. You might just like it. For those who are not sure about it, this probably isn't for you if you're casting even a little doubt. I would highly recommend these AM titles; Grim Legends, Nightmares of the Deep, or Enigmatis.",1,0

339610,FreeStyle 2: Street Basketball,"April 1st Review(04/01/15): Freestyle 2 is a third-person shooter, action, MMORPG, team-based, real time strategy(RTS), sports, simulation, godly game. No one should ever talk ♥♥♥♥ about this glorious, godly game. This game deserves a 10/10 especially in the support, options, and spelling department(do they have a spelling department?). Please, rate 11/10 and play game all day everyday. Definitely no BS and no fail mechanics like good-ping-to-rebound, late blocking, bs blocks, or bs shots. NONE OF THIS IS IN THE GAME. DEFINITELY ALL BASKETBALL MECHANICS ARE LEGIT. THERE ARE DEFINITELY NO HACKERS IN THIS GAME...  Legit Review(02/03/16): After playing this game for 10 months, it is safe to say that the company who runs this game is complete garbage. They do not care about the community at all, and would rather look for the game to turn into a gambling simulator than a fun basketball game. They do not care about hackers, and let them roam free. I would definitely be hesitant about picking this game up, but I will still recommend it because I still enjoy it very much. For other folks who are starting out...  meh.  Updated(12/25/16): The game has still not moved the server to central, which cuts out an entire side of the United States from playing a big man. They have been 'testing' where to put the server, but it has been going on for months now.  Tl;dr: Game is an arcadey-basketball game. A gambler's P2W game...",-1,1
258970,Gauntlet™,"I love this game, though I was a bit disappointed in a few things, sadly. Lets start on the negative first. The world variety is lacking in this one, I don't mean to say that this game should be something like Dark Legacy, but that is what compensated for the previous game lacked. The only theme here is caves, mines, and Hell... it kinda starts to all blend in together, caves, caves, caves, lots of caves. Something that kinda baffles me is how Colosseum has ice spawners, poison spawners, yet no ice worlds or jungle levels? The boss battles didn't feel as grand and epic though, the bosses having invuln frames felt like they're there to drag out the battle, not increase difficulty, don't get me wrong, I like a challenging monster to fight, but know the difference between challenging and tedious. Oh also, its Gauntlet, find someone to play with cos this can be played single player, but this is a multiplayer game, always has been, always will!   The positive! The heroes are different! Anyone who knows the previous Gauntlet games would take note of this first! Though I adore Dark Legacy with a passion &lt;3 something that was troublesome was that all the classes were the same, they all just start with different stats though, that isn't the case in this game! The warrior is all about throwing his weight around, charging right into the hordes you fight! The elf has the enemies running in circles to catch him! The Valkyrie is able to dash into a horde and defend teammates! The wizard, oh my god the wizard! I never had any idea how to differentiate a wizard class in a game like this! They used a simplified version of Magicka's spells, but still something neat!  The enemies are something too! I love how they even got the enemies to differ from each other as well &lt;3 I am actually very glad that ArrowHead did that! The mummies having their own mages, bloated mummies! Skeleton archers! Juggernauts, spider queens, the list goes on!    Final thoughts I would buy this game 3 times over if it had the level variety of Dark Legacy, yet managed to have all classes different from each other! To this day, to whoever reads this maybe many years down the line, I am awaiting a game that meets that description, a game that is as grand adventure as Dark Legacy, yet provide enough variety throughout! I don't see such a game like that coming out soon, maybe not even within my lifetime. I await the day I can go on a quest to slay a fearsome yeti, enter the nightmare realm, deal with a wizard summoner who is obsessed with the desecrated temple! The game is great, it gives plenty new but doesn't change too much, keeps the old but does something new! I want more of this!  I'll close this at this point now, a great game to play with friends if you like fighting massive hoards of enemies, I eagerly await the next installment!",1,0

498240,Batman - The Telltale Series,"I'm a huge fan of both Telltale games and Batman, and to me it didn't do any justice to Batman and all the lore. I must admit I did like Catwoman's attitude, they kept her believable as you would expect from Catwoman, but the three main villains are so ridiculously boring with the shock factor at the end of episode 3 being something so dumb I lost my entire interest to finish the remaining episodes. And with good right, it just drags on from there and I wished it would just end. Apart from the absurd story we get some 'evidence linking scenes' that seem to be borrowed from the Sherlock Holmes games, but much more annoying. And we also get a lot of 'planning the approach before quicktime madness ensues. Choose to take the bad guy out with option 1 or 2'. And again, and again. None of these scenes are well done. Telltale could take an example from their excellent quicktime action scenes from Tales of the Borderlands. And for Batman as a character they could have looked more at their main character from The wolf among us. Batman: The Telltale Game feels like a step back from those games. I do not recommend this at all.  Oh, and I didn't even mention the technical issues this one has. It suffers from frame drops and back to desktop crashes. Be warned.",-1,0

223510,Miasmata,"This is not an action game: there is no combat although there is an animal on the island which will kill you if you fail to hide from it.  This is a game of exploration: you are stranded on an island, suffering from a plague. The cure is on this Island although those that made it are all dead. You explore the island, mapping it as you go, searching for the plants required to create the cure (as well as the scientists notes with regards as to which plants you actually require). In your diseased state you are weak. A slight fall, dehydration or lack of sleep will lead to a fever...left untreated the fever will kill you. You can use various plants around the island to synthesise drugs to combat the fever or to increase your strenght, endurance and awareness.  In this game it is the environment which is your enemy: the island is a mountainous, jungle environment full of steap slopes: in Miasmata your body has momentum and navigating all of those hills becomes a matter of life or death. You will slide, trip and fall but it all feels very natural.  I loved this game: the island setting is well realised...the sounds of the environment are very well done, while the lighting is fantastic.  The game was made by two people, with an engine they built specifically for the purpose. There are rough patches to the graphics but I can honestly say that I never noticed them unless I went looking for them.  I highly recommend it, but it may not be to everyone's taste.",1,0

Lost Coast is a removed section of the original Half Life 2 game in which you liberate a small sea-side town from the Combine forces. What intrests me the most is that the Fisherman NPC, a NPC exclusive to this REMOVED section, is one of, if not Valve's highest quality NPC's when it comes to detail and animations.

Three major gameplay elements to the game: Base building, Research management, and down and gritty turn based strategy. Despite so far having been mostly horrible at managing my base, all of the components mentioned make for an stellar(intentional.) experience. Capturing your first alien is one of the most rewarding moments i've had in gaming in a long long time. Highly recommend to people interested, or maybe new to, turn based strategy games.

347670,Karate Master 2 Knock Down Blow,"Old school Karate action done right in the 2D world drawing on influences of some of the most challenging competition games ever made from Karate Champ to Street Fighter. No crazy complex combos, the simple controls allow for strategic planning of your moves precisely when used in this competitive fighter. Many games people buy because their cheap then never play one hour of them, this game is to awesome to not play. This game does the hardest thing in gaming, taking a simple concept and making it fun to play with working controls. The competition style of the game uses a variety of moves that force the player NOT to just mash the buttons but plan each move to become a black belt master of their own. The game is riddled with spelling errors and sentences that make no sense, but all that anyone needs to understand is 'Karate is life!!!!' At first many will think the strange phrasing of sentences is some kind of retro feel, though after checking their website, it seems to just be the way they write in general for whatever reason. Either way it is awesome and fits the game perfectly.   This game has the most important aspect working flawlessly, the ai opponents are challenging and its never the same fight twice. The music in the game is just as hardcore as the visuals. Sick of boring drawn out realistic hipster type games from the last few years? If so then karate Master 2 is your cure! As the game says, get ready to 'get covered in glory.' How often does anyone get to say that? Imagine someone asking you how your day is, now finally you can reply saying you are covered in glory. What a good day to be you!  Rating: 10/10 Value: $9.99  *for those who want the awesomesauce of Karate Master 1, its free from the developer and can be downloaded on their official website:  http://www.criansoft.com/eng/Karate%20Master%20KDB.html",1,1

New types of cargo (that will make you throw your keyboard against the wall). New and different ship upgrades and offensive/defensive modules. This will require some trial and error until you figure it all out, but it adds more depth and I like it.  Overall 9/10.   (Docked 1 point for lack of a pause button. I used to troll people who would refuse to play the game because it lacked a pause button (which would be immensely convenient during combat) but in the end I have to agree.

Few things to note: + vibrant and colorful game world (really loving the character art and sprites) + simple yet engaging story backed by quirky characters and funny dialogs + solid game mechanics and pacing + awesome music\sound (in fact I bought this after Shovel Knight which also has an amazing score written by the same guy - Jake Kaufman) + challenging! [Though sometimes it's too forgiving: pitfalls\spikes - IMO most frequent death-dealers - only cost you quarter of heart; it felt they should take more, like a whole heart. I ended up with ton of healing items unused]  + bug-free   My only issues are quite miniscule: - controls mapping. Because this is a port, it has some awkward control gimmicks: separate inventory pages buttons, shoot\talk single button, Hat button instead of 'hold jump', scimitar instead of 'down while in air'.

218620,PAYDAY 2,"Before I start off I am at a standstill for if I like this game or not. PayDay 2 is an Heist Simulator where you rob banks a do other various criminal acts. But there are things I like and dont like about this game and Im going to talk about it.  Cons: First off I will say Overkill is following in the footsteps of EA and release DLC constantly without acually updating the game. This kills the fun because of having to open your wallet, or not, everytime theres a new update, sometimes of community reasons (that I will get to later) and everytime they release DLC theres less content in the pack. I recently purchased The Alesso Heist and really have buyers remorse. Yeah the DLC offers some cool masks that you have to do IMPOSSIBLE achievments to unlock. Example, Sounds of silence, complete the heist without KILLING ANYONE. I had my friend who hacks help me because in Alesso you HAVE TO KILL AT LEAST 1 PERSON TO ENSURE 30% chance you will complete the heist stealth. But I do love the Matever .357 aka The Pocket Sniper. Just add more GOOD free content.  Second: Biggest complaint, the community. After the 2015 Summer Sale PD2's crime net was flooded with kids. Most of the time or 100% of the time the host is lvl 89 and is doing four stores because they cant do bank heist or a lobby will have atlest 1 kid in it. Ive had to kick 15 kids after the sale because the little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s were annoying the ♥♥♥♥ outa me on Alesso. Then theres about 80% of the community thats full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, know it alls, control freaks, and the ♥♥♥♥er who likes to kick everyone at the end of the Heist (the reason I host my own games even though my connection is ♥♥♥♥). Be prepaired to be kicked almost 60% when joining a game. Then theres the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ whos sole purpose is to make the game a living hell ex yelling and kicking other players when they dun goofed. And finaly theres people like me, wanting to play just for fun not giving a ♥♥♥♥ when someone ♥♥♥♥es up (but if you do go afk for a long time in an assault wave without reason, expect to be kicked). I play just so I can do heists I want to do ex The Diamond Overkill, Hotline Miami Overkill most of the heists you dont see and probably havent played. Forgot to mention that some lobbys people are only looking for achievments and im talking about mask ones where everyone in the lobby MUST have a heist specific mask ex Hotline Miami and Big Bank and will kick you if you dont have a mask, so if you see this leave the lobby.  Third and lastly: Bugs, I NEVER stealth on PD2 and just recently changed ALL my stealth guns to regular killing machines as they were meant to be. Because of BIG DESYNC issues and if you dont know what that is imagine if you are stealthing Bank Heist or Big Bank, a guard you see on your screen could be in a different positon on the hosts screen so if you kill him in a storage room his lifeless body drops to the floor in front of a dozen people failing stealth due to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ programing. Guards and civies can also spot you through walls during stealth, again ♥♥♥♥♥♥ programing. Tazers hitboxes on you and your hitbox in general are big but on targets they are random, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ programing. Guns that should be powerfull are not when you try them out, really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PROGRAMING. And last optimization, this brings the game down from what I would give it a 7/10 to a 4/10. This is a big problem that the devs have known since the game has been out (beta testers guys) and even on low settings the framerate on Overkill difficulty is capped at 14 FPS. Might be my fault for having a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computer but TERA runs better at mid settings. Sometimes PD2 will run better on high settings WTF. Dont get this game if your computer isnt built for gaming.  Now for the Pros and it really saves itself from my dislike. Cutting this review short the gameplay is awesome, its filled with action and shooting cops is really satisfying when you put them down. Stealthing is also fun (but I dont recommend it) is fun because its stressful and you really got to be aware of everything thats happening. Gunplay is probably the best Ive seen and the guns feel like they have real weigh to them and not just like in most shooter games they have realistic kick. Most of the heists have different objectives that give it some variety and if you dont focus on the drill and just stick to killing cops time flyes by REAL FAST and the vault will be open before you know it. Yeah its got some major flaws but its a heist game where you play by your own rules not what the game wants you to like GTA Onlines Heists where everythings a ♥♥♥♥in chore. Look past all the negatives and this game is worth getting. So after that you can either try it out for yourself or not depending on you for the most part but theres something about it that keeps me wanting to get back on and rob a few banks or pull off 'impossible jobs' everytime I think about it. Hope this helped and thanks for reading my review.",1,0
356330,NA,"TL;DR: Game isn't like Monster Hunter. Got a Blue Screen twice in the hour I played and I've never received a Blue Screen on that machine before. Clicking quest objectives will walk you to where you need to be, which I have mixed feelings about. There is at least one (optional) quest that requires you to open up the web shop and buy an item with real money.  Review: I wanted to like this game, I really did. The videos make it look like a chibi/anime Monster Hunter. That's false advertising for what I played. Maybe the game changes once you get further in, but I'm not really willing to give the game any more of my time.  To start, I had an existing Aeria account that got banned for violating some terms of service. The thing is, I haven't used my Aeria account since the release of Shaiya, which was around 7 years ago. I went through the process of recovering my account which took several days. I finally got access last night (12/5/15) and started up the game. I was able to start the game, which then crashed during the very first video before I even hit a server select screen. Subsequent attempts to start the game resulted in a browser window opening up that said 'Success' and then would not proceed any further. After a few more attempts, I finally got in the game.  Once I picked my class, named and designed my character (and companion), the game threw me into a tutorial. No big deal. But that's where I noticed the game had action bars like any other MMO. Already a bad sign for what I thought was Monster Hunter. Granted, those expectations are probably my own fault. I completed the tutorial and was greeted with a video for the game. Cool, a trailer for the game in the game. I continued questing and realized that I didn't need to button-mash 1 for my first skill. Instead, if you hold it down, you just keep attacking. Between that and being able to click on objectives to walk to them and sometimes complete them, the game practically plays itself. While it's nice to be walked to an objective sometimes, it felt like the game didn't care if I actually had to play it at all.  As I continued playing, I realized that I was skipping all of the quest text. None of it mattered to me. I also noticed that I was progressing ridiculously fast. I don't know what max level is, but I was at least level 15 within 45 minutes or so. I quit playing when I was presented with a side quest where the objective said I should open the web store and buy some Dragomon Medicine. The item costs 199 AP, or $1.99 in real-world money. Yes, a quest that requires you to buy cash shop items exists. I didn't stick around to find out if more quests were like that.  Pros: It's free You can find items that let you ride the monsters you kill Looks decent if you like chibi/anime styles The game will show you paths (and follow them) when you click on quest objectives  Cons: Game crashed at startup once Game couldn't be started at all for 10-15 minutes Game caused my computer to blue screen twice within an hour There is at least one quest that can't be completely unless you spend real money Assets/textures were flickering on the main screen quite often Combat is extremely simple Advertisements for the game are in the game Plays like an MMO (mobs show red areas where their attacks will hit) The game will show you paths (and follow them) when you click on quest objectives",-1,0

Uses a currency system called Supply that lets you choose your loadout, armor, ammo type, explosives, etc. to a pretty solid degree.

17410,Mirror's Edge,"A novel idea but so poorly executed. The idea of a parkour style running action game is great but the way it's been done here with the exception of some good levels is just not good. The action and controls are so incredibly bad it's really hard to believe that this game comes from the same company that makes Battlefield. There are some highlights in the game, I really liked the story, the take on a near future dystopian society including the artwork and the parkour movements that takes place outside. The action, animations (not talking about the cutscenes) and controls however are so bloody clunky. For disarming an enemy you have to approach them, wait for their gun to turn red and then click to disarm them but even with slowmotion enabled (think Max Payne style but worse) and you can clearly see their gun turning red you will still fail to disarm them. The animations of the enemies are so clunky and stiff... just makes the whole game look and feel 10 years older than it really is. The controls are also very much outta wack. Randomly it will allow you wall jump/walk and when jumping towards pipes that you need to grab on to, regardless of hitting them the exact same spot you might just fall through the pipe instead and drop to your death, incredibly frustrating given the fact that the whole game is based around parkour and being able to do it without having to worry if it'll work this time or not. I found playing the game really frustrating due to what I wrote above so I just don't feel like I can recommend that you should buy this game.",-1,0

105600,Terraria,"The introduction of 1.3 made Terraria totally amazing. Before then, it was still pretty amazing. I bought this game on a whim on Xbox 360 a few years ago, and it was probably the best decision in my life. I had to get it on PC after hearing about the Moon Lord's addition to the game. I would HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone. If you're confused about controls, you can check the options, they'll tell you. And most important of all, Terraria is NOT a 2D version of Minecraft; the similarities stop at the ability to mine and build the environment, that's it. Terraria is more geared toward combat and progression, but still gets points for exploration, and you can still build pretty cool things in Terraria as well. The wiring system is far easier to use, and is getting improved soon in an update. The only real issue is once you defeat the last boss and do everything you want to do, the game is essentially over. However, this game is LOADED with content, from all sorts of crazy weapons and enemies to different armors with different abilities, and the game has very high replay value; just make a new character and start all over again! Even not compared to Minecraft, it is still a great game on its own. The $10 is worth it, trust me. If you're thinking about buying this game, then proceed.  EDIT: The wiring system is now improved with 1.3.1, and the game will continue to be updated and improved.",1,0

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Good game, poor end game. Play through the storyline of this game and leave it at that. It's a great game and lots of fun to play. I really enjoyed the storyline. The big point on this game was really the multiplayer. Long awaited and asked for by millions for many years. We finally got what we wanted, too bad it wasn't done right. Yes, you can do multiplayer and have a ton of fun if you do a private game with a friend, but I recommend staying off the public servers with a lot of people. No, I'm not salty because my super expensive car got destroyed, that's a part of the game. I did find it rather annoying that if you attack another player in the game, you are charge a lot of money for it. You can assign bounties, but the player that collects the bounty is charged for having killed the player with the bounty and usually charged and insane amount for insurance for having blown up their vehicle in the process. It's a flawed system that forces you to run, usually boring, missions to grind for cash just to have fun in PVP around San Andres. Remove the fines for doing PVP and it would be great fun.  I'm not going to recommend this game simply because the big feature of the game, the multiplayer, isn't all that good. If you really enjoyed playing the other games, then get this just for the single player mode alone. Was good fun.",-1,0
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"This is an extremely good game. If you are a fan of the series you won't be disappointed, and remarkably if you are also a lore-nerd for Warhammer then I think you'll agree that this game is pretty spot on. If you're just browsing and you don't know a thing about Warhammer and have never played the Total War series then don't ignore it. A friend of mine picked this title up recently with no prior knowledge and is loving it.   The game is beauiful, the battles interesting, the unit interactions and rosters are fantastic. I suppose a minor criticism might be that regardless of which Lord you start your campaign with you start in each Factions capital. This limits replayability a little as you can't play any subfactions of the Empire or of ther Dwarfs, for example. This really doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the game though.   The diplomacy is harder than in previous games, and trading can be extremely tricky to set up depending on which faction you are. This, appropriately, swings the game more towards war and fighting, which is no bad thing.   Each faction has a unique playstyle and this is really what makes the game great. I'm looking forward to seeing what DLC CA release. At the moment the factions are a bit thin on the ground, but that just leaves room to develop this game organically.   There's lots more to this game than mentioned here, but I'm too busy playing it to write any more... which probably says something!",1,0

221040,Resident Evil 6,"While this game has taken a huge turn away from the old resident evil games, I still had a great time playing this game. It really isn't horror anymore but more like buddy action movie with monsters and explosions. The gameplay has it's ups and downs, on one side you have more fluidity of movement than any other RE game, you can do skill rolls, diving/sliding shooting, and melee freely which all feels awesome. Unfortunately theres a few too many chase sequences that are hard to control and will leave you frustrated. I feel the 69/100 metacritc ranking is a bit too harsh, but it's understandable considering capcom still tries to call this 'survival horror'. No, walking around with 2 bullets left in your gun holding your intestines in is survival horror, not Michael Bay style chase scenes every 2 minutes.  The design choices may not have been popular but this game is still a high quality production with plenty of value in terms of game length and replayability. Best played through with a friend, and don't expect anyone to be playing the minigames online either, that community died before it ever lived no thanks to the matchmaking being broken for the first 2 months.

The 70's setting is properly executed, but so is the other time-travel period, As a big fan of dark ambient, I really appreciated the soundtrack, which sets the mood perfectly. The graphics are sharp and detailed, with their own style. There is not much talking in this game, but when there is, voice acting is done well. I can't really find anything to criticize, I simply loved it.  Keep in mind however that it's not particularly long and the puzzles are easy.

242960,Blood Omen 2: Legacy of Kain,"No autosaves, just a fair warning  I had played through a 3 hour session, and stood on a few circles that I thought were checkpoints. I quit the game, and I was pretty mad to come back later to see that I had to start ALL THE WAY FROM THE BEGINNING.   It's going to take a few weeks for me to bring myself to actually start over, but I'd say the game is pretty fun. It has very memorable experiences and characters, and the combat mechanics are pretty deep once you progress further into the game. I'm talking about jumping on people's backs and knocking them down, or getting mad enough to push someone a few feet away. The boss fights are also very fun, and offer a few puzzle experiences.   Despite its age, Blood Omen 2: Legacy of Kain manages to deliver an experience that feel much like a modern action game, but has the complexity and challenge that older games gave you.

3730,Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000,"EDIT:NO NO MARINES ARE COMPLETELY FINE. THIS GAME IS BEAUTIFUL. Seriously, grab this game over the other version of avp. Because I actually ENJOYED THE MULTIPLAYER WITH THIS GAME. Forget what I said about 'the mp doesn't feel strategic' because that's obviously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  The thing I love about this game is that it sets the tone of a survival horror type game quite well. It's not scary like amnesia but scary in the sense that you're out of ammo, low on health trying to get around the aliens in the level. The level design is colorful but still manages to be dark and creepy. There are a few different aliens in the game but when you meet the Praetorians or the Predaliens, you'll be running or fighting for your life. The Alien Queen level has probably been the most fun/scary part of the game.  I haven't finished the Alien campaign but I managed to beat Marine and Predator campaigns on the hardest difficulties. The predator campaign throws you up against endless amounts of aliens while leaving you with limited power and ammo. Aliens will mostly best Predators in a melee and if you want to one shot them you need to charge your plasma bolt which takes a lot of power. Gameplay is fast, fun, and adds a small element of horror combined with an excellent level design. The only other game I've played that had this kind of level design was F.E.A.R. which wasn't too different. There are upgrades, ammo, armor, etc. and in order to get special upgrades was to search or explore the level.  As for multiplayer, I kind of ♥♥♥♥♥ about it time to time. The Marines from what I've seen are probably the best, since you can corner camp and gun down countless adversaries with your minigun. It's not fun, just watching two marines sit in a corner and kill you instantly. Not only that, when you're cloaked as a predator they can still see you (if they're veteran) and Aliens don't seem to have too many advantages, sure they have speed, but it means nothing against a guy with perfect aim. The only way I've been able to beat these marines was to use the disc (considered op) and the spear gun (I prefer the spear gun because you have one disc). There's not much element of stealth or strategy in the game, imo, just twitch shooting and melee is quite strange.  If you want to pick up a well designed game with a somewhat decent multiplayer, then sure! Go ahead.",1,0

17460,Mass Effect (2007),"the story seems decent and all, i want to recommend it. but i can't. i didn't even finish the game.   i am not an fps guy, i mainly wanted to taste this 'amazing' game everyone told me about and was very disappointed. the balancing of enemies is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, you get shot down in 1-2 shots while they may need ♥♥♥♥tons to kill, companions mostly die and you have to manage everything they do (even if you have set the 'power use' on active). in the end i even managed to die even with a cheat for lots of shields (which brings me back to questionable balancing).  i'd be more inclined to play 'normaly' but guess what. you have to manually save EVERY TIME. last time i forgot about it, i was set back by 2 tedius hours of fighting and talking and ♥♥♥♥. No. just no. for 2016 this is just not what i look for.  Most of your time in the game is just in some corridor, or an elevator (and there are hell of a lot of them).  performance is hurting. (i read somewhere that computers can be 'too good' for this game and it slows it down O.o)  it has its merits. i guess if you don't suck at fps combat and if you remember to save every second step you would be probably fine and if you manage to bypass the performance issues.  me? i can't recommend this. just watch a playthrough on youtube.  TL;DR:  ♥♥♥♥ balancing.  ♥♥♥♥ performance.  if you get it you will get frustrated till it plays decently. you will die and remember the last save was yesterday. not recommended. watch playthrough on youtube.  PS. don't get me wrong. it is not like i want my game to be easy. i just don't want it to be frustrating. this is frustrating.",-1,1

2870,X Rebirth,"I would be lieing if I said the game is good, even when there is a patch there will be an excessive amount of bugs that will basically screw over any process you make. I haven't played it for quite a long time and all of the reviews can probably point out as to why I haven't touched it. However I do not agree with the people that said it was a waste of money (you can see this game as an alpha game even though this is somehow the full release).  If you are a fan of Sci-fi, space and glowy blue or retina burning things then this is a game for you. However I would still give it a 5.5/10 (It's somewhat addictive once you have made a lot of money, simple way to make it is through accepting neighborhood watch &amp; cartel raids, seriously once you're friends with them and bought some licenses every small craft = 1 ~ 5 grand extra ontop of the mission, 20k for a capital ship. Another way is through buying a ton of food and going to space stations that need them, they will pay extra.) ;D  P.s: it has some seriously relaxing music in it.",1,0

391260,Labyronia RPG,"I'm a person that loves RPG Maker games; my avatar's the Batter from OFF, for crying out loud. I enjoy going on  rpgmaker.net  and seeing the things that some people can make. A lot of people stereotype RPG Maker games to be low effort when there's just as many games that have care put into them, with original graphics and everything.  But this game - and all other games by the creator - symbolizes that stereotype.  Labryonia just seems to use the default assets provided by the RPG Maker VX Ace engine along with some resources that seem to be pulled from resource packs. The only original things seem to be those book pages you find lying around every now and then, but even then they all just seem like text pasted onto a page template. As for the story, it's pretty much humdrum elemental stuff. If you're in for an incredibly basic JRPG experience, sure, it's fine, but as some games like To the Moon demonstrates, RPG Maker could be used to tell incredible stories, and sadly Labryonia is as bland as it is uninspired.  My play time looks short, yes, but the beginning parts of the game looks like an omen of mediocrity to come. Allow me to rant. The first, real dungeon of the game is the Water Labyrinth. The first dungeon of a game should be easy and interesting (though not overly interesting - the real fascinating stuff should be saved for toward the end), but this dungeon is neither. It's like the Hell Maze from Yume Nikki except somehow worse, and it's real easy to get lost an/or hit dead-ends. The whole dungeon is blue. It's an eyesore. There is little varience in dungeon design as well, save for the occasional red crystal. See, you're supposed to find all these red crystals to open the door to the boss... but of course these crystals are hidden all throughout the dungeon so you'll be stuck with the tedious and eye-killing task of walking around the badly designed dungeon. There are two reprieves though, I'll have to admit. Thankfully encounters in dungeons are on-screen and not random encounters; if they were, I would have dropped the game right then and there. Secondly, there is an item that gives you regenerating AP (the game's version of MP), so you'll be able to heal off any damage you take. If you're sincerely playing this game, I recommend picking this up. Meanwhile, the actual boss fight is manageable - if extremely tedious like everything else.  Now that is not a good way to start a game off. Games should ease you into the experience, not bore or frustrate you into senselessness, but Labryonia did just that. I'm honestly shocked that this game has such a good rating on Steam. If  rpgmaker.net  had more users and momentum, I'm sure that the game would have gotten completely savaged like most other low-effort works. In all honesty, the only reason why I picked this and the second game up is because it was dirt cheap and I'm a sucker for easy Steam cards.  Do you want a good RPG Maker game? This is not one. I recommend going on RPG Maker sites and poking around for anything good. I personally recommend Grist of Flies and HOME if you're looking for anything recent-ish. Want to throw your money at an RPG Maker game? Why not give Lisa: The Painful RPG and To the Moon a go instead of this?  But then again, this game is dirt cheap, so why not?  (If there is one thing to praise about this game though, I like the idea of gaining skills from certain sources. If this was a good game this would push the player to explore, providing incentive beyond a chest full of gold or items. Too bad this isn't a good game.)",-1,0

221040,Resident Evil 6,"This game is rough to say the least, it had the potential to be amazing and fell short due to poor execution. That being said it is not without its right to be praised on certain features, just as well as it is deserving of being bashed for its poor ones.  The Good: The melee system (best feature IMO)- Feels fluidic for the first time in a resident evil game, and its even more satisfying when you're playing jake,no more circle jerking in place by pulling out your knife and swinging like someone having a seizure whilst leaving you wide open too attack.  The dodge/ Reaction attack mechanics- Truly adds a sense of control for the character while being attacked and moving to evade oncoming fire, and its satisfying as hell to stop an enemies attack and return one in kind in one move.  Character variety- Every character has some for of uniqueness to them, they dont feel like they all came from the exact same mold, and painted with a different skin and voice actor.  Leon/Jake- Three CONTROLABLE baddasses in one game, along side their trusty (AI is still bad) partner (clean up isle my pants). I was extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when Wesker was infected with the las plagas and then soon after killed off as he was easilly one of my favorite characters, but godamn does his baddassery live on through his son.  The Bad:  AI- The AI of your partner in this game is like an eternal punishment consisting of stepping on legos every 30 seconds for the rest of your life, as well as getting a cheese grater forced into your anal cavity everytime you blink or breathe by a demented midget clown in a pink tutu, whos simultaneously tea bagging you.  Frustrating vehicle handling- the vehicle handling (particularly the snowmobiles) makes me want to rip off my clothes and start screaming that god has abandoned me.  Weapons- Shooting an enemy feels like it doesnt do crap but tickle the enemy with feather sensually afer a successful date that leads to your lovers apartment, until you get overpowered weapons and or character upgrades. I legit feel like id have more success chasing enemies away by exposing myself and running at them wildly, with my donger swinging like a damn helicopter blade as I do so.  Camera angles- Not all of the are bad by any means, but holy hell when they are its like my fartbox is being tongue punched by a woodchipper on steroids.   I play this game and will continue to play it for story progression alone because im literally that loyal to the series ( zombies are my weakness), all in all i give this game a solid 3/hippopotamus.",-1,1

218620,PAYDAY 2,"TL;DR: Good game. Sucks that you have to pay so much per DLC.  It's a good game. It costs $20 as of the time of writing (26/6/15).  The DLC is a little excessive.  Do I want to pay $7 (more than a third of what the game costs) to get access to one single 20-40 minute heist?  No. Not really.  Do I want to pay $5 (a quarter of the game's price) to get access to ONE new character that I can play as? (purely cosmetic)  No. Not really.  Would I recommend this game?  Sure. Just don't think you should buy the DLC. You can still play the heists (just you can't load them up yourself, you need to join someone who has it up)  I don't enjoy saying this. I've had &gt; 350 hours of fun playing this game, so that's a testament to its playability. However, don't spend all of your money. I bought a lot of DLC for this game, and I don't regret it, but I'm at the point where I don't WANT to buy any more. PAYDAY 2 has ripped out my wallet and taken more than $50... when the DLCs themselves only provide 20-40 minutes of stuff.  Sure, heists aren't  too  repetitive, but they get a little repetitive.

Whoever has the least military and most science or faith, immediately gets bullied by more superior AIs. I'm not just saying this, I have seen this happen to me. I meet 2 empires that are doing good in the game, and are not that good at science, and like five turns later they both go to war with me. I didn't think much of it, considering they might go to peace, but then one of them (scythia) starts to take one of my towns. The scythian empire is in the rennocanse era. (If i could actually spell this would be much less hectic) and I was too, but she got there faster. And I was just bullied out of the game that fast. Snap. That fast. I cannot handle how cruel the AI is to players and This is the reason I do not reccomend the game.

383870,Firewatch,"There's not much to say about this game without spoiling it, so I will leave my opinion about the story at this: It is very good. Unlike half the people that have played this game, I enjoyed the plot and it's conclusion and will happily explain how in a private message. The characters are phenominal and there's really nothing unforgettable about them. Voice acting and dialog writing are top notch as well.  The atmosphere is honsetly the best one I've ever seen. Seriously, just take a look at some screenshots. You could take a picture of nearly anything in this game and it would look BEAUTIFUL. The soundtrack is very mellow and fits with the tone of the game very well. Sound design is amazing. It just really feels like you are out there in the Shoshone as Henry.  Gameplay would be a hit and miss for some people. If you are looking for amazing mechanics, you'll be out of luck. It would fall under the semi-new 'Walking-Simulator' genre. But it is more than that. The game has you navigate the terrain with a map and a compass and that's it. There is an option to turn off the map indicator for Henry which would leave you only able to know where you are based on natural landmarks. I left it on mostly because I didn't know of the option before reading about it later, but that seems like the best way to play the game.  Also the game is pretty short. I got through it in 4 hours.  Overall I do recommend this game. The plot and characters are phenominal and the atmosphere is one of the best. If you aren't fan of exploration maybe take a pass and watch it online or something.

Its not liberty city, its not standart city of america, its russian liberty city. In this place we can hear russians speech, its beautiful. Well... its funny) perhaps this is the only product, in which the Russian didn't look ridiculous) here it is an integral part of the gameplay and atmosphere  The best simulator of immigrants(well actually here it is possible to fully feel the Holy cross, latest cross simulator, everything is fine, but lower is better) ) Well, seriously, its a good game with a special atmosphere, different from other games in the series. Even GTA 5 will not replace this game, every self-respecting gamer should play this masterpiece. So... I dont know,but this game has something special...

319630,Life is Strange™,"This game was just amazing. The summary of the Steam reviews sums it up really well: 'overwhelmingly positive'.  The story is deep and great. The graphics are really good-looking. The gameplay is really enjoyable, and relaxing. You could really well compare it to Telltale's style, even though I think it is even better: more polished, on a better engine, and with a deeper story. It's hard to review it like this.  Don't play this game if you expect something adventure-like, and adrenaline-based, even if you'll get some; the pace of Life is Strange is quite relaxing, and you'll end up believing you're Max, a high-school photography student. Who can control time.  The fact that it's episodic really bodes well. Some people won't like it; but I do like playing episodes as they come out, it keeps it fresh. Of course, I can't say the next episodes will be good at the time I'm writing this, but I can't see how they could be bad.  If this review makes you interested in the game, or even excites you, just p l a y i t a l r e a d y. You really won't regret it.",1,0

201810,Wolfenstein: The New Order,"Wolfenstein the New Order is a basic FPS game focused solely on the campaign of the game. If you want a multiplayer, avoid this game. The game runs on the new ID Tech5 Engine, which looks pretty good. Since its a brand new game engine I don't believe its been stretched to its limits yet. Which leads me to believe that the better games will come of it.  This game is Wolfenstein. With hidden room, treasures, and big baddies to fight. It is to its roots wolfenstein.  Wolfenstein the New Order is the sequel to the reboot Wolfenstein by Raven Software. Although this game was developerd by Bethesda. I haven't played the prequel, but I can say you don't need to. The prequel was available on computer but you will need to search the internet for copies, otherwise you will have to pick it up on console.  The game opens with you flying towards the Antagonist (Deathshead) castle. Your job is to invade the castle and take out the general of the german army before they can take over the world with their advanced weapons of war.  In the plane with you is a British soldier by the name of Fergus. Fergus walks you through the turtorial, which is going through your plane preventing its from being shot down by flak coming from Deathhead's stronghold.   At some point you are forced to abandon your plane and jump to another where you are introduced to a yound american soldier named Wyatt. Before you jump your plane Wyatt gets on your comms and is fearful that their pilots are dead and their plane is going into a nose dive. Fergus directs Wyatt to take control of the plane so it does not fall into the ocean and kills dozens of soldiers on board.  Once you jump over, you move to the cockpit of Wyatts plane where a small amount of dialogue is exchanged. After that you get shot down and must travel through trenches to the castle. It doesn't take long to get to the castle walls where you scale it and invade the castle.  Inside you eventually run into Deathshead, trapped. He captures you with a group of super soldiers he has created. He evaluates whats left of your invasion team and forces you to make a choice between Wyatt and Fergus. The choice you make here will effect your gameplay through the rest of the game. In my first playthrough I chose to save Wyatt, after you save him Deathshead leaves you to die in an incinerator room. For saving Wyatt you have to pick a lock on a window to escape the room.  In my just started 2nd playthrough I saved Fergus. Instead of picking a lock I had to hotwire a control panel. This one of the differences thats comes of who you save. But its not just the mechanice that changes, its also the places you get access to. In the level after, I had to fight through a German Checkpoint. One of the buildings from my first playthrough I could pick locks into the building. In my 2nd playthrough the locks were still there, but because I saved Fergus I could not pick them, essentially keeping me out of the building.  Another key difference between who you save is also the secret items you pick up. If you save Wyatt you find grey/black soldier figures that increase the amount of armor you receive when picking it up. The effect is higher the more you collect throughout the game. If you save Fergus however, it permanently increases your Health by 10. The figures are instead red and have a different stance than the black figures.  I have not played through Fergus' story long enough to know all the differences nor would I list them all, as it would ruin the game for others.  There are a number of different weapons for you to use that allow to you play the way to want, as well as being able to dual-weild most weapons. Although I found the certain weapons were less viable, due to the lack of ammo availble for them.  The game also features perk trees that help you focus on how you want to play. The trees are accessed through the journal. You aren't forced to choose a specific tree and the requirements for each perk are usually completing some sort of challenge like stealth killing 10 people or something similar.  My overall experience with the game was enjoyable, but I wish the game was longer so that the story could be better fleshed out. The length of the game is already pretty long but they go through a lot which is why I wanted it to be longer. I doubt there will be any DLC or sequel for the game however.  tl;dr My opinion of this game is that if you really want a Wolfenstein experience then I don't think you'll be let down. But if you are just looking for something to play wait for the price to go down or for the game to go on sale.",1,0

275850,No Man's Sky,"I did not know anything about this game until a friend was talking about it. I love to explore in games, and I love space...So I bought it. Yes, it does get repeititve, but I keep searching for that awesome planet out there somewhere still.. lol. A lot of physics and scientific details are missing...and those things could have really made the game much more impressive. Basically, it's a VERY simple game with no problem solving required, and not much battle skill is needed either.  Aside from all of the corners that were cut in making it, and its simplicity...for some reason I stil like it. It could be because I had no set expectations for what it was... I did not know all of the features that were promised and not implemented. I just run around on different planets and explore derp around. I am sort of getting bored of it now sadly.   I can understand with all of the negative reviews now that I know what the game was SUPPOSED to be. I can't give it a negative myself, because I feel i've gotten enough hours of enjoyment to make it worth my while. I think it is overpriced for what it is, but I don't regret purchasing it...so that's  good...yeah?  lol   I don't know if I would recommend it or not, because it depends on the type of game player. You will hate it or love it...but since I liked it... I guess i'll click 'yes'..?",1,1

342580,12 Labours of Hercules,"The running joke in The 12 Labours of Hercules is that Our Mighty Hero only rarely rouses himself to do any actual labour - his trusty servants (ahem, slaves) race about at your command cutting down trees, clearing roads, filling in pits, picking up resources, building bridges, and erecting supply centers. Except when there's a star-powered Hero Task to do, Hercules spends levels resting happily in his hammock.   In each of this game's 40 levels you basically need to get across the map. That may involve clearing obstacles in the road; building bridges over rivers or ravines, or boats to sail away on; collecting gold for the trip; or disposing of monsters in your way. You'll gather riches (food, lumber, gold) to pay for everything you do, and generally there's just enough potential wealth in each map to make it to the end in time. Level design is attentive without being mean, and each level will run to solution in five to ten minutes, making this a perfect bite-sized casual game for I-have-a-few-minutes timing needs.   One clever and irritating design choice adds weight to game achievements by way of in-game monuments. Completing each level in Gold time (there are 10 levels per stage, four stages in all) builds a section of four acient artifacts that have nothing to do with anything, but sit there accusingly when they are only partially completed. In one stage, for example, you're building the Argo, and how can you not finish the Argo? It appeals to fundamental tinkering instincts, and makes the game hard (for me, at least) to complete casually. Because, you know, we've got to finish the Argo before we move on. Right?   Whether you breeze through 12 Labours, or dump hours and hours of just-one-more-try time into the durn thing - I'm at over 60 hours on Steam at this point - depends on two things: whether you are the sort of person who can peacefully leave your ancient wonders half-built, and whether you choose to play on Expert in the initial settings. Think carefully about this. The game is great pleasant fun, and making some of your Gold times on the Expert setting is HARD. With its little dollops of timed frustration, The 12 Labours of Hercules managed to fill up my scattered free time much more than I ever intended. You've been warned.   Once you finish this game, of course, parts II, III, and IV await. You've been warned, again.",1,1

381120,Shoppe Keep,"Such an awesome game with so much potential. Its great already but for going on playing, there is not enough content for me.  Please hurry, bringing more updates :P Co-op would be cool, such as animal breed or monster breed. Shop Assistants, more options for bots, more variety of items, better fighting, competitors, not only quests for selling but for going on an adventure by yourself instead of sending the champion, costumization of your own house, maybe some more depth in defending like monsters and more barbarians and maybe towers you can place outside to defend your shop. Colouring the furniture and walls. Mod-Support would be very important. It makes the game even better and then people are starting to talk about this game. The possibilities are endless with mods and i would be so happy to see some of these features in the future. PLEASE implement them! I would pay for more features because it is one of my favourite games. I want this game and developers to have a great future.  EDIT:   Today was the final Release of the game. The update itself brought just a few MINOR changes, no new content. Out of Early Access?! The game is not finished. Still the same bugs. Even what they promised in their forums like breeding is still missing. There also is still this 'contruction site' ingame. It was one the of best Early Access games i've ever seen but now its also one of the worst releases. There is a good negative review, last edited in august 15 i think, which complains about lack of content and the 'not finished feeling'. This game has no depth in this state. This is still what i think after full release of the game. I am disappointed...

I love FTL and other rogue-like games, but this game takes any of that potential fun and hides it behind a slow, sluggish grind and uninspired micromanagement.   All of the screenshots and videos I saw showed the interesting world that I thought would be fun to explore. It turns out, most interesting locations can't be interacted with in any way, so the long boring sail it took to get to them feels wasted. Once you know a successful trade route, you learn to exploit that and use it to start your voyage each time. This gets repetitve and boring so quickly, I had to uninstall it.  I really wanted to like this game, as the aesthetics are amazing, and the writing is witty, but the game itself is a massive waste of my time.

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"Where to start.. Well, After playing a bit of almost all the modes, except nightmares, I do indeed like this game and think its an okay touch-up from Black Ops 3. But, after drudging through the campaign with frame drops and stutters from hell, I find it to be a good story, but the PC optimization for this game is so bad that I've read that even people with 'Super Rigs' have trouble with the stuttering and freezing. I feel like they should have figured a fix for these issues, even after almost a year after release, which shows how much they care for their PC fanbase. Multiplayer and Zombies I don't have that many problems with, but it can still be jittery. I have a PC capable of Maxing out this and other games, but no matter the settings, it will still have its moments where it acts like it wants to crash. After manually changing a number in a file (which I should not have to, c'mon Treyarch), the multiplayer and zombies gamemodes run better than before. With the addition of the workshop, it is nice to see fan made creations playable, and that is really the only reason to get this game for PC. If you don't really care for that and only want the base game and its DLC, buy it on PS4 or XBONE, as I've seen smoother gameplay for those systems.  Also, I know you don't have to buy any of the Black Market crap, but hiding content behind a paywall, of a RANDOMIZED supply drop, is a pretty weak move for a (IMO) dying franchise. But you know, if you want to spend money for that cool looking weapon skin or exclusive weapon, go right ahead.   All in All: 5/10 - Needs better ports and less 'pay for cod points' crap and instead should offer challenges to unlock special stuff.",-1,0

Enemy design, the first thing you fight is the most buff mofo around, which undermines the rest of the designs which were just the same anyhow. 3. The combat, now some might say its good, but it felt so very heavy handed, which is something i found to be a setback, it came off as egging me to play defensive and i could never begin to play offensive. 4. The fact there are like...2 areas, a casle, and a demon castle. I thought i would be playing my journey to this keep but just getting there and being like, well lets go undermined the whole aspect of a journey. 5. the final bossfight was pathetic, it was for one utterly impossible to do without gimmicks i found and it was weasrly mutant thingy, I thought i was gonna fight the GOD but for some reason i just had to fight the guy, its pathetic.

I feel that after an hour or so you were desensitized to killing, wich never excites me in a 'horror of reality' game such as this. The comabt was fun but unorgininal, i would've liked to see some inivative mechanics. Overall i would reccomend that you buy this game if you are a core gamer who has exhausted his library, but if not then there are other games you could better spend your money on.",1,0
227300,Euro Truck Simulator 2,"This game, this ♥♥♥♥ing game. This game is a nightmare, it is insanity, it is the creatures, that creep in the dark, this game, is death incarnate. This game will be burned onto your screen, as it will be burned into your mind, into your soul. This game is absorbing. It will suck you in, the gameplay, the graphics, and the mechanics. It’s all so perfect, to perfect. It is so calming, so nice, so serene and pristine. But, you can't be deceived by the game; it has a wall of innocence, not knowing of the outside world, no calming. The scenery outside, traveling Europe as a trucker, what more could you want? But wait, a car crashes into you, you your life savings, one red-light violation, you lose all your money, you go over the speed limit by 1kmp, ONE ♥♥♥♥ING KILOMETER PER HOUR, JUST ONE, and guess what, you lose everything, all that you have worked for. Why, just why, why have we been put into this eternal nightmare, that is known as Euro Truck Simulator 2? Why, why can't we stop the suffering, why must this game, never stop its torturing, to be stuck playing this game forever? This game is taking more and more people, and putting them into the nightmare simulation known as 'trucking'. But we can't stop it, we can't it’s too absorbing, too intriguing, it’s too much for me to handle. I had to find a window of opportunity to escape the evil clutches of the simulation. But alas, the power of the game is to strong, and I will be soon brought back into the simulation, to play for all eternity. So DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. It can't be stopped and never will, and, shows no signs of stopping.  tl;dr: 9.5/10 The reverse gear is really weird.",1,1

391540,Undertale,"At this time, you are likely reading this review because the hype you heard: friends saying to buy and play it, or you saw some videos or neat music on Youtube.  Don't let aparent overexcited hype dissuade you from the game. $10US is cheap for what it offers, easilly enough to make your own judgment. If your friends feel as strongly they might have offered to buy the game for you.   As a retro style game it makes good use out of the graphics of the age. The music while sounding much like the 16-bit music it's trying to emulate is very catchy and has already spawned many remixes of the themes on Youtube. The box 'Combat' system is interesting and often enough surprising to keep you on your toes. There are many Easter eggs and side bits are numerous and often require different playthroughs to see them. Battles change on depending on your playstle; you might fight one monster one way, or another by a different path.  The characters are interesting, often endearing. They react to how you play the game; even the random NPCs you meet have different reactions based on how the game progresses. The humor is goofy at times, but still quite amusing. The story is well written and easilly captures people's heartstrings depending on your emotional investment in the game.  I highly recommend taking the chance and play without any spoilers or guides just for the fun of it on your first playthrough. My hat is off to Toby Fox on the depth placed into this game. I hope to see more from him.",1,0
255420,NA,"There are some faults. It should be noted that this is my first DotP experiance but I've been playing paper MTG for a while.   There are some issues; it's slow and sometimes the AI cheats and does things that aren't legal. For example, I was playing against the Kor deck and lost to my opponent 'Kicking' his creature to make it unblockable for lethal (I had like 4 blockers for his 2 creatures and the creature he 'kicked' had been in play since the 3rd turn - it was about the 8th turn at that point so legally it shouldn't have happened as 'Kicking' is an entering play ability - SUPER ANNOYING and I would have won the next turn had this not occured). It wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't the kicked creature that then attacked and killed me.  I like that you can create your own deck but dislike that it has such hash restrictions like only being able to play 1 of each Mythic, 2 of each rare and 3 of each uncommon. It's particularly annoying when the bosses tend to have such a tempo advantage against you anyway as they're running Tropical Islands and Bayous, etc. against my crappy Guildgate lands.  Anyway, I've just completed the single player game playing a GW Token deck. The only really difficult games I came accross was the Mirror guy (playing my own deck against me only with insanely lucky hands) and Garruks' game 1 (who just drew perfectly every game). Its a bizzarre system, I lost a few rounds to decks that seemed impossible then I'd rematch and they'd flip to being almost too easy! That's MTG I suppose.",-1,0
368230,Kingdom: Classic,"So......this game has a very good concept and design along with execution until a point.....and that point seems to be with when you hit mid game or aim for beating it as then you look at what's been done and have to try to find the precise triggers to avoid killing yourself as gold early on is precious but once you get a good supply constantly going on you then need to worry about men, buildings, travel times, armenment and finally  battle.....why?  Well.....  For starters when you start the game you usually end up with two camps on each side of the kingdom before you hit the first portal and then another two after that but......those camps usually start until you remove the tree closested to them on both of their sides or so. But you may need to remove it to get access to a stream or building place and you go then meh you got three more to get men from but that can quickly turn to one as you find that you need to get closer to the portals to avoid your attack parties taking a day to get to the portal, more on that later. But you then end up with less and less camps close by to restock your forces if you take a really big hit and that wouldn't be a problem if there was maybe a way to get them inside your walls like maybe...I duunno......have a family back at your home base? Or build a Tavern somewhere or make some sort of unit that can headhunt more people or attract people to your kingdom. There is many ways but none of these were put in and just means that once you build up fully to the last portals and you killed the camps you kill yourself, it hurts to destroy a camp as you are pretty much disabling yourself.  Now that brings me to the buildings where they are okay to a point......as it seems like the game is set in mediveal times some what which where they had walls and towers but....they also had it eventually be that they could have wallls that they stood on and shot down at the enemy while getting some protection and towers gave protection too as they went completely stone made with turrets and being enclosed. Now this is completely forgotten about it seems with the game as you can get those better buildings as they aren't possible to make and so makes your men much less effective and protected since the flying monsters can't then just take guys out of towers like they were picking apples and your men could then hit the enemies hiding right up against the wall which often require the tower men to take them out somewhat. This also could be improved with the siege weapons which you can only build one of for each side and can't make a permement upgrade to the walls or building to have one just be there. It would also be nice to imrpove the already existing shops you get so that the people that pick up their items can take more hits, move faster, do their job better or have a blacksmith being able to be built which can give those bonuses however that isn't the most needed thing with buildings.....as their a bigger dog in that kennel which is having it be possible to make a bow stand or hammer stand be made where you want or need it to be made as it can take forever for people to get from their camp to your stands and then head all the way back they came to the wall and so being able to make that shorter by moving or making stands closer would just be a blessing and takes me to the traveling times....  Ah travelling something that you do every day usually as you got to your bed to the kitchen to get your breakfast......it usually takes time right? And you know about how long it can take right? Well you have to sorta learn how long it will take for you to travel to one side of the map to the other to recuit men and have it so that they can get inside your walls before darkness comes and usually it ends up being that for the far off camps you need to get going for them right at dawn and sometimes they will make it before night time arrives depending on how big you've expanded your kingdom...but that's ridiculous travel time.....as they are always shuffling along....so slowly when they could be exicited to work for you and run back before semi running to their post so that then they make the entire trip to your base before a day is done. Because why not a run mode for them when something urgent needs to be done that you can just blow a horn or something and they go double the speed for some time with whatever they are doing because you get a run button for you going around the place and it takes forever still to get from one side of the map to the other so for those guys just shuffling away it's really painful and hurts you....like why not have a horse carraige or something come along and pick them up or something like a unit which just goes out and gets those new recuits safe within the walls and once they are he takes them to where they need to go or be....as you can't do that only follow them back while wondering what they are thinking with seeing you behind them on a horse which can race to safety. But your horse even isn't enough as well.....if you expand out too far you can spend a day getting from one front to another so it would be nice to have some sort of faster way to move around inside your base like.....maybe putting down tile paths or something which improve move speed and reduce then travel times overall? Because it just seems like your going around always in the dirt or mud in your base while the forest is covered in grass and moss which I guess would be easier to go along than just dirt or mud but upgrading that terrain of where you've deforrested to increase movement speed would be and excellent addition to the game and improve it so much more and may remove the need of some things for a while or somewhat at least.  Okay now armrment.....which I did touch on a little already but....there's more problems with it....like with knowning how many people are what so you can then plan according as to what you want and how much from the stands as I find that having four builders is the most you need for you small size while archers you just need a lot of and farmers you need a constant level of them to avoid having money troubles so......if your able to set a sorta limit on how many of each unit you want would be nice along with a auto resupply mechanic too.....as then you can tell when your losing troops too suddenly as at night you don't know where they enemy is attacking until they attack and you hear it or find it, both of which have a very short range...and so middle game you can struggle to know when your getting attacked and where...anyway it would be nice to have more siege weapons too as well since you get this building area for them and...you can only build one weapon for each side and that's it...which also has bad aim too as well as it can't hit enemies at all really that are against the wall licking it. Also...with what I said about the upgrading of your people it would be nice of where you can give them coins so that they can lose those first before their tools and finally their recruitment coin or just those extra coins means that they can take more hits after losing their tools and so can retreat better too. This would also be nice for getting new weapons too for dealing with those flying creatures as the bows don't start firing at them until they are right up and close which then you need a ton of archers to dps them down. I also struggle to see the point of knights in a defensive role too as they don't try to rush out and attack the enemy...they just hold up their shield and hit their sword against it while bouncing hits..like..why do they have the swords if they aren't going to simply try and attack with them?? Like is there no melee attacks in the game for your units at all? Since like they could try to defend themselves if they are going to not run from the enemy.  Anyway I would write more but I've run out of characters so I'll just say this the game is good at the start but annoying after that.",1,0

While this game may not be like CoD, it dissapointingly doesn't improve that much. There are a few tiny maps, and all the deaths keep happening at the exact same choke points. The game tries to make teamwork matter, but fails because it's just too rewarding to go off on your own and outflank your enemy, while sticking together just increases the chances of your entire squad getting mowed down by one guy.   The only non-urban map in the game is utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because of the complete lack of foilage and cover spots. Most of your deaths will come completely at random from snipers, and even if you get attacked by a sniper with particularily bad aim, you will likely die anyway because you simply cant take cover. The whole map is just bare hills.   With all the hype this game has been getting, it's a bit disappointing, but still fun.",1,0

99810,Bulletstorm,"Bulletstorm is a first person shooter where the player plays as the character Grayson Hunt. This now drunken space pirate was a former member of some elite commando assassin whatnot team called Dead Echo. Grayson rashly defected when he discovered this general was corrupt.   Presentation wise this game is fairly polished. I remember being pretty impressed with many of the visuals of the game. As far as gameplay is concerned this game presents the player with a number of weapons which are fun and satisfying to use. This game features a 'trick-shot' system that awards the player for performing stunts with the various weapons.   This game falls short in difficulty (or lack thereof). This is a problem with many triple-a games. This game presented 4 difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard and Very Hard. I played this game right after taking a break from the brutal punishment which is Dark Souls so I chose Hard, expecting a reasonable challenge but not to the point of frustration. At one point there was a boss that I nearly took out on my first try (mind you half of the time I spent simply figuring out how to take him out).   Maybe this game would have been better if I chose 'Very Hard' but still, needing to choose the highest possible difficulty level to get an experience that is not a complete walk in the park leaves this story-driven single player first person shooter no room for replay value, but perhaps this is by design.   Because this game does have it's fun moments and is pretty polished, I will recommend getting this game on sale if you like first person shooters but because of the lack of real challege I'm not going to give it a particularly compelling score.  7/10",1,0

94400,Nidhogg,"I purchased this game for three reasons: the overwhelmingly good reviews by some trusted critics, the fact that it supports local gameplay and because of its retro charme that goes beyond the usual NES/SNES look and feel. The game certainly is a lot of fun for an hour or two until you realize that it's never going to be more than what you experienced in that time. It features four settings in which a sword duel between two adversaries takes place. The look is like an old Atari 2600 game and the game certainly is fun. So why the bad review you might ask. Because it's just too expensive for what it is. Compared to many other games and to what they offer for 13,99€, a game with blocky pixels and just four arenas should not cost more than 5€. This is exactly the price this game feels like. My verdict: get this game if you're looking for quick, uncomplicated local or network vs, but only if it's offered at a bargain price of under 5€, or better under 3€. Otherwise, get Apotheon for approximately the same price, a full campaign and the same vs fun, but with more weapons and nicer graphics. To be honest, in the end, Nidhogg feels a bit like a scam.",-1,0

The hitbox detection is much better in worm.is, with little ambiguity when you run into somebody. It never feels like you've been cheated, whereas in slither.io this is often the case as the hitboxes are smaller than the worms themselves.  There is significantly less lag and stutter in worm.is than slither.io. The ability to choose server is also nice.  One downside is that the pace of the game feels slower in worm.is, the acceleration of the worms is just not very fast. slither.io definitely feels more fast paced. Additionally, the map still feels rather small compared to slither.io.  I started playing after the May 7th update, so perhaps this has fixed many of the issues which older reviews have mentioned.",1,1
312780,Way of the Samurai 4,"Above and beyond the technical stuff, the game itself is wonderful. A bizarre mix of the absurdity of Deadly Premonition and the campy dialogue and weapon collect-a-thons of Dynasty Warriors, with branching paths to rival Alpha Protocol. The 1850s town of Amihama is your samurai’s own sandbox, in which you’re free to pursue alliances with one of the three competing factions, or just go and do your own thing.  Doing your own thing can mean dressing up like Blood on the Tracks era Bob Dylan and harassing every civilian you see. Or running strange errands for a guy under some carriage tracks. Or conspiring with some ultra-nationalists in a cave. Or sassing a government official in the middle of his big speech. Or failing to communicate with British people because the language school isn’t open yet.  The PC version of Way of the Samurai 4 offers (much) higher resolutions, a solid (albeit capped) frame-rate, and much-reduced loading times over its console counterpart. It’s a stable, straightforward port with constraints that largely seem tied to things that were out of the coders’ hands, but fans of the series will definitely enjoy this cult classic.",1,1

40400,AI War: Fleet Command,"Ai War is by far the most in depth RTS game I have ever played. The learning curve is rather steep but there are good resources on YouTube to help break the ice. The game seems completely and utterly overwhelming at first but once you sink your teeth into it you will find it quite rewarding. It can be an extremelly challenging game and isn't exactly a casual experience. When you play the game your brain feels fully invested in the task that lies before you. Learning essential hotkeys is key to reduce micromanagement which I find the trickiest part of the game. As you get deeper into the game and play on bigger maps you will need to manage your forces and strategically place them in defensive and offensive positions. I found it difficult to do this and have a tendency to just cluster all my ships in one big wolf pack. Game knowledge and micromanagement are keys to mastering Ai War.   Definitely an underrated gem and one of the most beautifully made RTS games I've ever played. Definitely recommend this game if you are are looking for a challenging and rewarding RTS game to add to your library. The soundtrack is very, very good too.",1,1

I played this with a controller, and had no issues at all with the controls, other than getting confused which joystick controlled which brother at times. Which was amusing at the more faster paced moments, and caused my brain fumble to get the little brother killed on numerous occasions. Whoops.   It's a very short game, with a great story. I really loved that even though the brothers don't speak a recognisable language (to me anyway, for all I know it could be a real language, if so I apologise for my ignorance) but are still able to communicate to us the player what we need to guide them to do, and how we should do it.

9880,Champions Online,"Its crazy fun selecting what your character looks like. In fact, thats where my first 3 hours game time is spent! But instantly when you join the game, the graphics change to something not quite as good looking, but it is easily over looked.  It seems all starting characters are about as equally tough in comparison to each other. The tank doesn't seem anymore of a tank than a ranged character seems ranged. I feel like the game is supposed to take classes into account when you reach level 10. But why not let us play starting from level 10 then?   On the same note, other games make you go to level 60, but this stops at 40. So why didn't they just strip off the first 10 levels of grinding too? Just to be sure, I want you to know that I am not complaining there aren't a million levels to grind. My complaint is that if they had the foresight to remove the last 20 level grind, why didn't they also remove the first 10 level grind too?  The worst part, is that it seems that your powers and skills are no different from anyone else playing the same class. Your personal touch is left to how your character looks. Your character's uniqueness stops once you choose your class. Basically setting your character in stone once you leave character creation.   UPDATE:",1,0

206440,To the Moon,The gameplay itself is flat and boring. The graphics are at best practical with no own significant stylistic approach. But who cares? This game is simply beautifully written in a way you have to force yourself to stop playing. It's a narrational experience that hardly has any equal.

43000,Front Mission Evolved,"If you are a fan of Mech games and mechs in general, then this is a game to have in your library, its fun (I also recomend having a controler to play the game, its alot more fun that way) and if you are a fan of the old front mission games, then you will love it, its action packed, the graphic are good and its a rly fun game. The only down side is that the multiplayer is down which is a shame, i think if it was still active and goin, it would be even more fun to play multiplayer with friends who own the game, and other people aswell",1,0
218620,PAYDAY 2,"Payday 2 is a good game, but its a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the ground of thing  The bad thing: Yeah you now it, they are about to conquer the highscores withing dlc's. Payday 2 doesnt got a workshop or a modding to the game. When you not got the people to make maps weapons or skins in a workshop. The creator can earn lots of money on dlc's. People are saying make a new game, and yeah they are right and the game should have a modding community and be better.  The good thing: I know people that have played this really much and yeah its funny. Its in a way not so hard but also hard, in rush you just go in and do what a person says kills police and get out. Then if you want it to be bit more challenging you can do it silent, you get objectives by the speaker but you need to find a way to do it. Its not easy said he can say pickup 15 paintaings and avoid the guards. The game is not realistic but on the other side its easy. if the guard sees a bag on the other side of the road he will call the police. You can go into bank with fully equipped armor. Makes it really fun",-1,0
327310,The Marvellous Miss Take,I like this a lot more than most 'stealth' games because I really don't have the patience for sitting around memorizing guard patterns. The movements of the guards are pretty random and getting a quick run of the stage is rewarded...they definately want you to misdirect and snatch things rather than hide in a corner. the 3 characters even play differently and each is needed to progress. Pretty fun all around.,1,0
620,Portal 2,Portal 2 is nothing short of awesome.

493340,Planet Coaster,"The depth of this game is immense but the great thing about it is you can make it as deep as you want to. If you want to just hit up the career mode and complete the challenges, do it. Or maybe you prefer to build a park completely from scratch with infinite cash and no need to worry about the mangement aspect of the game, well you can do that too. Or maybe you just want to build stuff (seriously I havent had this much fun since I played lego as a kid). Yes minecraft exploited the idea of open world, infinite construction, but this game takes it to the next level. (if you don't believe me then just look up the star wars park on youtube!!).  If all that's not enough to convince you to part with what is typically half the price of most other AAA titles then maybe I should mention the other major aspect which is the ability to create and upload your own creations (a roller coaster, a building, scenery, a WHOLE PARK and more!) to steam workshop for others to share. And you can use items that others have created in the community too!  Yes there are a few bugs, yes there are some areas of the game that still need to be expanded and developed further but overall, if you are a sim game fan (or maybe you want to try out the genre) I really don't think you can go wrong at this price point, especially with the assumption that Frontier will continue to add additional DLC content (clearly at addeitional cost) and develop core features (which you will continue to get for the original price).  There's just too much to say to justify how amazing this game looks, feels and plays. If you're unsure about a purchase then drop onto youtube or twitch and check out any of the many, many community streamers that have already adopted the game. (it's only just come out but there is already a massive, passionate following!)  If your looking for a relaxed game to add to your library that you can spend hours on creating and showing off your master pieces, or maybe building a whole park as a project with friends then I don't see you can go wrong.",1,0

If a game does that to you then they have truly succeeded in my book. I hope they take it further in the next title so i can enjoy it like i did this one.

The quests are uninteresting, the combat is grindy, the ui is terrible, customer service is unresponsive, optimization is an fps hitter even though I have specs way over minimum, the social aspect of it (chatting, guilds, etc) is garbage, everything about this game is just bad. Please don't be an idiot like me and make the same mistake of buying this. Also it's worth noting that they have a real jerk move in the game where once you download half the game on steam you have to download the other half in the launcher which took me over 2+ hours to download. What that means is before I even could tell if I liked the game or not I wasn't eligible for a refund because all my playtime was sunk into the download.",-1,1

239350,Spelunky,"Much higher difficulty curb than I expected. Let's make a list:  1. Gameplay consists of one level, broken into four parts. If you die, you must start back at the very beginning. No items saved, no 'experience' that would level up your character to let you take more damage, move faster, or hit harder, you just die and restart to try it again. 2. Four hits, and you die. It's very easy to get hurt. It's possible to take a hit or two just from throwing a rock if it bounces off the wall and hits your character! Some traps will make you lose more than one hit at a time, or kill you outright. I don't believe there's any 'invincibility-recovery time'. (A-la megaman.) 3. The only way to recover health is to rescue a 'Damsel', which is a scared woman/man/dog that if you bring to the exit alive, then it will give you a kiss and restore ONE HIT when you progress to the next stage only. THAT'S IT. I've heard there are 'kissing booths' where you can pay to get health back, but I haven't seen one.  So you'll die. You're gonna die, a lot. And since the levels are generated randomly each time, you can't learn any particular pattern or predict where you'll meet an enemy on your next playthrough. You've just got to learn in general what to expect and take things as they come. There is no room for any error whatsoever. The game is just not forgiving in the slightest.  I guess that doesn't necessarily make it a 'bad' game, but I expected something... easier. I was lured in by the cute caricatures into thinking it would be something more like Terraria except without the minecraft elements and I got something more close to the original Castlevania minus any gradual difficulty increase. In summation: could be worth a look, but when the description says 'challenging experience,' it means it.",1,0

The ultraviolet nature and the absence of an easy to follow story makes can even keep you up st night trying to figure out what the actual ♥♥♥♥ just happened after you complete your first 5-10 hour run of the game. After that the game could have have more or less playability but you can always go for a new high score. Because I know have like a's and b's and most levels because I have replayed it once. Anyways if you have like 970 GeForce or up don't be afraid to run everything at max settings. If I was IGN I'd probably give this a 9,4/10 because the replay value does deteriorate over time.

All you do is beat one course and then you are done. The music in love is okay. I didn't find any of the songs stuck in my head I found them floating in one ear and out the other. There was one level when the music was so....I don't think I should say 'bad' but I wanted to finish the level so I wouldn't have to hear the music! The levels are hard!

I'll review this endearing gem below in pro/con format.  PROS: *The game contains inspirational messages and sometimes my character strobes in rainbow colors.. Its filled with colorful hearts and mushrooms and treasure! *During the main storyline its possible to bless your bald character with a head of thick, curly, musty hair(s). *Most of the basement's citizens greet you with a big, toothy smile. Its a friendly place, overall.. *The main characters aren't afraid to cry. A lot. *You get to team up with awesome animals, like cats and birds and larvae.. *Reunite with lost loved ones! Or pieces of them, anyway..    CONS: *There are campfires in the basement, but no marshmallows. *Someone in the basement has corn, but isn't sharing. *The cieling leaks, there is feces in the floor, someone is dead in the corner, people keep locking doors and hiding my money; I hate my roomates. *I've got Jesus juice on my mouth and can't wipe it off. *I dislike the basement design.. Seems like the contractor focused on devious difficulty and traps instead of color, space, and theme.. Not a decorative pillow in the whole place.. *I keep ending up getting pooped on, and getting my weiner exposed, which makes the game quite emotional at times.. *The end-game fight against Raptor Jesus is bugged.. *None of the dungeon residents know how to respect my personal space. *I take lots of pills and shots but never get to smoke anything..

230410,Warframe,"♦Introduction: This is a dungeon/instances based action third person mmo (kinda like vindictus, dragon nest, etc) I have 1k+ hours.. and I play this since CBT (which was way before it came to steam) I can say for sure I gave this game my time and hopes for get a good experience as the game gets made on the go~ I really wanna write a wall of text explaining why this game is soo good and WHY is kinda bad at the same time, but let's be honest here nobody likes to read now days~ so ill try to keep it short starting with the good and bad things, but if you feel like reading bit more, please, do so.  ♦Good and Bad things: +New content every week. +Developers that are close to the community. +Not real paying restrictions that will f*ck up your enjoyment. +Nice graphics (they're nice, not mind blowing but nice) +Great amount/variety of characters with their unique set of skills. +Cool upgrade systems with mods (that look like 3d cards) which you can add to your character, weapons, pets, etc. +Well set up, in depth and immersive enviroments. +Variety of missions.  -It gets repetitive (yes, even though it does has several game modes, maps, and lots of content) -Long period of wait time for build (craft) each thing in the game, and you will be doing that a lot (we talking from 12h to 72h of wait time) These can be rushed with in game currency, but you don't wanna be doing that with every thing you build.. so it is definetly a downside. -Glitchy and buggy at times, plus cam angle will be a total mess if you downside your aim in close to any in game model (npc/other players will turn into giant monsters if you do so hahaha and I doubt they ever fix this) -LAG yes, this game will lag if you get paired with a bad host, you can 'fix' this by putting ping/region restriction, but keep in mind this is a F2p, most people playing will be people with not great internet connections and if you put restrictions you will find yourself playing alone most of the time. -Broken pvp, as this was never meant to be a pvp game, DEVS put it almost by force by high demand from the community and believe me, you wanna stay out of that and stick to pve experience. -It gets grindy at times, mainly toward 60+ hours when you start farming for new mods, and weapon parts.. etc you can get these by trade but the most rare ones will requiere almost an equal item rarity or platinum for make the trade happen. Also for rank (level) up your stuffs will need several time of grindy missions for get it done, no matter how many game modes they add into the game~ for get the stuff level up fast you will often find yourself playing the same game modes: survival and defense.  ♦A short txt of what you should know: The game started to be a very early beta (more alpha like) with only 1 map type, and the overall game was barely 2gigs size.. Now after 2 years (I think) the game is 10+ gigs. and that fact should give you an idea of how much content the developers put into the game ever since it was released. The game gets weekly updates, most of the time every wednesday and is just a new weapon, skin, or some random thing but you can be sure new content will arrieve every week. For MAJOR content update, these come every 2 to 3 months, and normaly it's a HUGE update that will change the entire game experience (unfortunally, so far, the core gameplay it's still the same and grindy.. I highly doubt they can improve that no matter what crazy content they add into the game)  ♦The So called 'F2P Restrictions': As almost every F2P they need to make some money out of you, and unfortunally is not just costume, or skins, they have a system in the game that went worst over time, this system is that will requiere certain amount of time to build (craft) every new weapons, warframes (heroes you play with), almost anything will requiere at least 12+ hour to build. BUT if you do decide you can 'RUSH' the build time instantly if you use 'Platinum' (in game currency that you can acquire by paying real money, or by doing trade with other players) It is not a huge downside, but it is something to keep in mind, as you won't really see it when you start playing, and more when you get at least 20 to 40+ hours in the game. Other restrictions that you will notice right when get into the game, is that you will need Platinum once again for buy warframe slots, weapon slots, pets...and almost everything will always requiere a slot that you will need to buy (these are cheap tho, 20p warframe, and just 12 for the rest.. you can get 75p for 5$ also, once again, you can get plat by trading with other players)   Overall and all I give a thumbs up because I did had my fair fun time with the game, and I do really recommend it, but keep it casual, this is not a game you wanna put 100s of hours in, as it will get repetitive and boring fairly quickly. The small restrictions are a bit of pain in the ♥♥♥, but is not that bad, is playable, enjoyable, but I feel the need to say that these restrictions will get worst over time so if I was you, I would play this casually. If you put the time in it (which I already stated that you should NOT do so) you could have a truly full FREE TO PLAY game.  --HAVE FUN!",1,0

Outlast had most of the things for a good horror game. It had great graphics, bones, blood, guts, ugly guys and even ugly guys with their ♥♥♥♥♥ out. Outlast had great story. It always keep me interested but of corse with all horror games it had some annoying tasks you had to do but the game even made them more interesting.

257850,Hyper Light Drifter,"Incredible game! So far it is a great mix of aesthetic beauty and mechanical beauty. It's a challenging game but it's fair meaning every point of damage can be avoided. Combat feels fluid and you truly feel in control of your character. The music is phenomenal and fits the game very well, little details litter the background as well as a myriad of secrets. After roughly an hour of gameplay there have already been a ton of different enemies each with unique attack patterns and appearance. There are few words in this game and in combination with the visual theme and the music it really adds up to create a powerful and mysterious atmosphere. 10/10 so far would recommend.

20920,The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,"Just finished The Witcher 2 and I got to admit it's like it tries to be both a RPG and a VN, yet fails (as I see it) to be either. I guess that's just because I like my RPGs to be action RPGs and my VN be no action (in the sense of text and choiced only, nothing else). Yet I will recommend it for I suppose it's not that the game is bad, it's that I wanted not the things this game has to offer me and it's kind of my fault for not having thought this through.  The fights are either too short (too few enemies) or either too hard (too strong enemies) the only fun being those fought when approaching the Harpies nests and on the Vergen's walls. Oh! And no experience for you, level up via the quests only, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (well, you technically can gain 2-3 levels by fighting during the game, but you have to fight loads of monsters, more than the game actually gives you. And you will not get the exp for them after some time, so no grinding for ya). The loot is poor and you are poor as the Price/Sell ratio is like x5, more for better items (buy for 2500, sell for 100, yeah, right. Or the crafting! Buy a recipe for 100 gold, buy ingridients for 150 gold + pay 20 gold to craft a subart... which you can buy for like 25 gold. Why, again?). Do I have to mention the horribly sluggish system of potions, alchemy, crafting, trading and menus in general? I had to ggole how to switch off the mouse smoothening (there is not a single PC player happy with mouse acceleration/deceleration)  The 'VN' element is... well it's not bad in and of itself, yet the differences in the endings are minute and the dialogue is diluted by the need to fight - or just run around - in between. So I won't be playing it through again, not in the nearest half a year, at least, I see no reason to. Fun is heavily diluted. For me at least.  What an irony, but for the aforementioned combination the game might have been actually fun for me. Like if the action RPG elements were to be enhanced and stripped off of all the dialogue nonsense OR if the VN elements (well it's kind of R part of the RPG, so you should give them credit for that) were to be enhanced with meaningful differencies in endings and without the need to have to fight 2-3 enemies in between (come on, 500 enemies slain only after playing for good 30 hours?)  But I assume all the modern 'story rich' RPGs are in some way like that (ME, DE, whatever else). Or am I mistaken and the fighting system and other 'action' elements of an RPG in those are fine? All in all I suppose personally I should have picked the Skyrim instead. Or Diablo 3, still haven't played but for its Demo.",1,0

4000,Garry's Mod,"Perhaps I am just stupid, but this has turned out to be the biggest exercise in frustration.... Fortunately, I got it on sale.  Firstly, you will need to watch YouTube or search online to even figure out how to use this. There is NOTHING in game to explain anything. Searching through Steam Community is equally frustrating because 1&gt; half the guides are in languages I don't speak and 2&gt; the search function can't seem to find a forest amongst all trees. And many of the online tutorials assume you know more than you do (the best video I watched for beginners tells you open the spawn menu, but doesn't tell you how to do it until 7 minutes later; The wiki tells you to do it by pressing O in one place and to press Q in another).  So, if you attempt to start this and you default into the flat map, you start out on top of this God-ugly structure. Unless you have figured out how to fly (search online), you have to jump off and you lose 10% health. A sandbox you can die in! And of course, this God-ugly structure is part of the map, so you can't get rid of it. Its in the way and its an eye-sore.  At this point, I attempt to build something, the entire reason I wanted this game in the first place. Place one object. Place a second one that pushes the first one away. Move the first object back, only to have it go flying off across the screen. Begin again. Place one object. Place a second using the controls and mods that were recommended online (again, nothing helpful in-game). Second objects bounces off the first one, hits me and I die. Game over.

287290,Resident Evil Revelations 2,"Lets get a couple things straight. This is a good game, i'm enjoying it more than RE6. Definately worth the money.   First things first, Splitscreen coop, guys, this is PC how often do you all REALLY play local coop on your computers? Let alone a RE game? Remember all of us used to ♥♥♥♥♥ about RE being coop with partners? And now all you want is coop. Yes it was misleading but it's still a good game solo, the way RE is meant to be. Online coop would be nice but don't let no coop stop you from playing this, it didn't stop you from playing RE4 I bet.  Second, DLC. For those of you who know capcom, this game has microtransactions and other minor DLC. Lots of you complained without thinking saying they cut things out of the game to sell seperately. This game is only $25, it comes with the maps and characters and all episodes for $40, Revalations 1 is $50... the dlc that isn't included isn't necessary, storage space, currency and weapons. All not needed and the guns can be bought in game with in game money. No one is being ripped of here... yet. So DLC is fine. They pulled things out to make the base game cheaper, you want more then pay for the full game at $40. All they did is give you options to pay less for the game if you don't want those extra things, that's pretty cool.  Third, Optimization. The game runs decent, it's very playable. The game was clearly made to run at 60. Dark Souls had problems forced past 30fps. Until patches come though to optimize the frame dips and stutters here's all you have to do to play it smooth as butter. Turn Vsync on and turn framerate to 60. Variable is what makes the character stutter and Vsync off will make the framerate drop occassionally. Change those two options for now and it's highly playable at a slight trade off of responsiveness.    My only complaint with this game is the Online Raid matchmaking is delayed until around the time the final episode releases about a month from now, that is going to hurt Raid as it sucks only playing solo.  Is this game worth the $25 price? So far yes, the game looks to be picking up speed and I like where the campaign is headed. Raid is fun and the first episode took me 2 1/2 hours on survival. If you want a taste, do what I did and buy the first episode, totally worth $6 as a RE fan.",1,0

209370,Analogue: A Hate Story,"This is one of the best visual novels I've ever played.  The premise is simple, yet compelling. You are a nameless, genderless, ageless space investigator sent to read the logs of the long-dead in order to understand what happened on board the generation ship, Mugunghwa. You do this with the assistances of two AI, *Hyun-ae, a young woman, and *Mute, the ship's security system. They are the powerful personalities that make this game worth playing, and if you're anything like me, you will fall in love with them both.  Warning: the logs deal with physical and emotional abuse aimed towards children. It also explores homophobia, speifically towards lesbians, misogyny and classism. Forgive me if I spelt any of those words wrong.  Analogue's gameplay is entirely text based. You will be reading log after log after log. Initially, the logs aren't that interesting, but very quickly, I was drawn into the game. The GUI is sleek and actually does feel like a futuristic computer. It's simple and easy to use, and it's unlikely you'll ever get lost. The most confusing it gets is when you need to prompt the AI to search for more logs by clicking on logs written by the particular person you wish to investigate.  (I hope that sentence made sense).  The real focus of this game is the AI, although Analogue focuses more on *Hyun-ae then *Mute. (*Mute's game is Hate Plus, the sequel to Analogue, which I also recommend you buy). I won't spoil anything, but through these women, you're confronted with some serious moral ambiguity. Actions and beliefs that are objectively terrible are rationalized, and suddenly you're not sure what to think.  The minor characters are basically every person you'll read about in the logs. They all serve their purpose; no-one is focused on so extensively that they over-shadow everyone else. Moreover, they all feel like real people. The logs are well written and feel genuine...although I do feel the lesbian sex between too women was written in more detail then strictly necessary.  Your choices matter in this game, btw, particular when you're finally given the option to stop being a genderless and ageless entity. Whether you select male or female will influnce one AI significantly.  Overall, this is a very good game. It's heart-felt, its well-written, its fascinating, and its cheap. Give Analogue a go, you won't regret it :)",1,0

The ability to choose the team size you use is also great, unlike in another fighting game, Marvel vs Capcom (The entire franchise.)

Having that choice is great, since you can make a team based off the characters you like to play and not have to worry about some filler character being thrown in for the purpose of having a complete team.   lab zero did a great job making this game.  11/1O.

104900,ORION: Prelude,"I'm torn. For the $1 I paid for it during the promotion, it's tons of shameless fun (I thought), and a nice deviation from the standard Killing Floor/zombie wave mods out there. That said, I have to look at this in the context of if it's worth its asking price and...  No.  The game is high production value Unreal Engine modification, but it lacks the attention to detail that makes Killing Floor so fun. Animations are janky, player textures frequently disappear mid-match (leaving behind their primary-colored models), hitboxes are off (why is a shot to the crest of the neck of a raptor considered a headshot, but shooting them in the head isn't?), levels are uninspiring copy-paste affairs (how many times am I going to see the same wrecked drill in a level?) with incredibly linear objective design (Base 2 is always the same spot, as is base 3, etc). Capturing the bases in Survival mode itself does nothing but progress the game to the next wave of dinosaurs, as even the vehicles spawn at the start of the match - you could have a buddy run to Base 3 for the Mech while you turn on the generator to start Wave One!  That's not to say the game is /bad/. Are there performance issues? Yes. Is the attention to detail lacking? Absolutely. Is it incredibly linear to the point of boredom after a while? You betcha. But until you really start to notice those things (about thirty minutes in, for me), the game is still fun in a mindless sort of way, especially with friends. That said though, for $15, I expect a lot more for my money than copy-pasted levels and textures, braindead AI, movement animations from the original Tribes (in terms of 'skating' over terrain), and a linear level experience.  For the $1 I paid for it, it feels like a discounted iPad app. Shame that when it's off sale, the developers are still asking for $15 for this thing. I'd like to see a lot more polish (and better netcode) before plunking down that much cash, especially when you're competing against similarly priced titles like Killing Floor, Starbound, etc, that are way better experiences overall.",-1,1

The relics are a cool feature but too rare and samey.  Even playing this with friends wouldn't keep me interested for very long. I can't recommend it at this point. Developers: make the classes as distinct in their gameplay as they are in their flavor! Give us equipment with interesting attributes! Give us *lots* of it!   I can excuse mediocre graphics and horrible 'voice acting' that is obviously just the developer growling into his $20 headset, but the gameplay needs to sparkle for that to happen - and right now, we're at a dull glimmer.",-1,0

It is not optimized well from a GPU stand point, so don't expect 60fps throughout.  Closing Thought - I do like walking sim games and I think this developer has some potential based on his games, but I just wish he would put the effort into making an actual, 6-8 hour Walking Sim that looked great and had a much deeper story.  /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////  - I made this short video for the sort of tricky to find 'Support From Underground' Achievement if you needed help finding it.

Example: You've got 2 builders - you want to build a wall on either side of the map = Both builders walk first to the left and then to the right side, instead of dividing and building each side on its own. Lost way to many games trough this, this is for me the biggest weakness.  - You cant reposition your peasents - Once a peasent is a farmer, he stays a farmer until he 'dies'.  - Your horsey needs to walk very slow after your sprint with it. While this is a good game mechanic at general, i would recommend to disable that while you're inside your Kingdom, since its getting really annoying riding that slow.  3 Simple Problems - When they're fixed I would recommend this game to everyone I know.

Double Heatsinks are a must, Endo-Steel is secondary, and Ferro-armor is third. Currently, Heavy mechs are the most competive, with Clan mechs able to outpace Inner Shpere mechs. I say this after being in this game for many years, and my experience with the game, NGNG, and  Mechspecs.com . These are my opinions, your experience and opinions will vary.

284950,Pixel Puzzles: Japan,"Recently I was extremely bored and looking for games in my massive steam library to get 100% achievements on. I ran across Pixel Puzzles: Japan which I picked up from some bundle offer at one point and installed it. My girlfriend came home from work and I asked her to play a video game with me, which is at times very hard to get her to do. She agreed and I decided to fire up this game, as she is quite the puzzle-holic and loves jigsaw puzzles. After hours of playtime, we got all of the achievements in the game and had a good time doing it.   Pixel Puzzles: Japan is basically a set of normal jigsaw puzzles on PC. There are 19 different puzzles in the game, which get incrementally larger the farther you go. Putting together the puzzles is fairly simple and works well overall. One large annoyance we experienced consistently is attempting to grab a piece from the 'pond', where the pieces you have yet to put down float around until you grab them. Whenever you try to grab a piece floating with others, the majority of the time the game will not grab the correct piece, causing frustration. This can be remedied by just pulling out a bunch of pieces and throwing them on your board, until you can grab the right one. As you place pieces in the correct spot, they lock onto the board to aid in speeding things up as well. The puzzles are all based on Japanese locations and themes, hence the name of the game.  Pixel Puzzles: Japan was a nice game to play over a few evenings to 100% achievements, and I recommend it if you can find it at a budget price.",1,0

There are only three levels and the playtime on them is about 10 hours tops, unless you really like exploring your options. Additionally, the game is too structured to promote that kind of creative problem solving.   I give it a 6/10. You're better off with a different game.",-1,0

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"One word: Underwhelming   This game is not worth $60-$70 let alone the collector addition (DLC grab). Short and sweet, do not get this game unless it's on sale for 19.99-24.99 that's the value I can give it.   It feels lackluster in content at launch and launch DLC should never be the answer for that void.   The matchmaking is nothing more then a headache, often times waiting and stuck on waiting for a player to load. So you back out and get penalized. You wait minutes before you finally get into a game only to hope your team isn't useless.   The other issue is I can't even find a full team multiple times searching, this game is brand new and I can't get a full game. Then when you back out because you only have 2 players total, you're stuck with a leave penalty!  I can't help but feel so blah over this game. I have no drive to play it for a length of time, no drive to log in. It's a game I log in to play a match or two when I need a chane of pace from other games. Again, not worth the $70 for a time filler.  The game looks and sounds great but this should have been a micro transaction, free to play model or a properly done full game (which it's not).  Shame on the company/developers for this half baked junk.  I will say once you get a good group of people going, it can be a lot of fun but that cocktail of luck is far and too few between.",-1,0

238430,Contagion,"The main game mode is called escape and sees up to 8 players try to work their way through a map full of zombies to escape a situation. The puzzles are pretty basic and usually involve finding an item to open a door or barrier. Each time you play the game the route changes, keys change location, different doors are unlockable/open, one game saw the team using vents to get around the map instead of taking the stairs. The zombies are easy enough to kill but a lack of ammo and limit to the number of things you can hold means that you often resort to using risky melee weapons. The limits on holding 5 things at once mean that through the game you do things such as swap a key for machine gun with no ammo(in the hope you will find ammo) only to find that the armory later in the game is locked..   Deathmatch sees up to 8 players battling it out on medium sized maps filled with zombies. While not strong the zombies are a great addition to the fight. The match is slow paced and it can be quite hard to find other human players, following a hoard who can smell human blood is a great way to track people down. Other ways to find humans include following flashlights, which works great when you see a small flash in the front room of the house next door or following gunshots. Gunshots is a great idea by the developers because at some point human players find themselves cornered in a loft with a zombie they need to take out; unfortunately, unless you have 5.1 sound its unlikely to help locate people that much.   I should point out the game is beta, so there is plenty of time for things to change. I don’t know how being a zombie can be more fun while not making them too powerful for humans. While it takes a while to hunt a human player down in escape mode, this stops the humans getting overran by 5 zombie players. I should also note that while being a zombie was a tad boring, playing as a human was really fun. It was also really tense, death actually meant something to the player and kept you on your toes.  I’m giving this 4.5 stars because I’m knowingly taking part in a beta. Perhaps I would give it 3.5 if this was the finished product, but it’s not. Reviewing games at this stage in their life is perhaps a little unfair, but I think its good giving games trying something new and following the kickstarter/green light/beta business models as much coverage as possible.   4.5/5 stars :D",1,0

17470,Dead Space,I had alot of fun with Dead Space but I didn't find it that scary. I was only jump-scared three times and I didn't feel much tension during the game. The weapon upgrade system is also just stupid because the item's you use to upgrade your weapons need to be used on empty slots to get more actual buffs.I only managed to upgrade two weapons (the only weapons I bough) and my armor. There was also two stupid turret sections that one was stupidly hard and one really easy. Other than what I mentioned above I had a great time with Dead Space and I recommend it for anyone who like's the science fiction genre.,1,0

It's quite challenging, but don't let dying over and over throw you off. This game is quite rougelike, with the randomly generated floors. The powerups vary from a laser that replaces your main projectile, your own tears, to using your own urine as a weapon (which is one of the worst items in the game). The game is great, but if you aren't sure about the game being on Flash, maybe you should wait for the remake.

The combat is frusterating and the controls are hard to configure if you aren't happy with the standard FPS bindings (for example, you can't bind any controls to the keypad [the numbers on the right of the keyboard] if you are right handed). The only reason you should get the game is because of The Black Rose for Spy in TF2. It's like this game is basically holding the awesome item hostage.

In the beginning your force to help one orc and if you were like me you get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thinking this is what they meant by manipulating orc heirarchy, but fast forward another hour to the end of the game and you get some limited options. Game is very short unless you want to hunt objects and wierd symbols for lore not gameplay then you can add several hours. The first main story boss teases you into thinking you will be able to fight the others, sadly all other boss fights are press this button or that one and congrats you won.   If you love assasins creed and lotr just mix the two with doing the same thing over and over you will love this game.   For me too short, and overall misleading in the new dynamic they try to throw into the game.",-1,0

Managing your community, leveling up your characters, fighting the dead with other survivors and looking for supplies. Plus it has extra 2 expansion packs that you get for free: Lifeline and Breakdown. Breakdown is pure survival while Lifeline was more fun than the actual state of decay non DLC campaign because it took the situation more seriously with the perspective of the army.

51100,Tactical Intervention,"This game is really easy if you play FPS's. Apparently kids with no arms play this game.  But really, this game has alot of potential and can be VERY fun if you play with a team that you can properly work with. It actually gets rather boring if you play against/with pubs because you just end up stomping if you have played an FPS before. I would say 85% of players cause the following gamebreaking issues as this game is all about teamwork, while the 15% are the heros in the match that do everything.   PUBS DO NOT - Heal you - Stick together - Communicate - Follow the objective - Kill enemies you would assume would be an easy kill for them  PUBS DO - Complain the game sucks because they didn't get a non default gun - Leave matches midway - Stand Still and watch enemies - Crash cars when driving  . This game works best if you organize a match with people you know. It gets really fun when you actually start having to use cover properly and work with teamates when fighting intelligent enemies.  *Recommend for groups of players, playing alone will only frustrate you*",1,0

13570,Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory,"Buy this damn game. Seriously. Even if you have not tried or played many games in the genre, this would be a fantastic one to start with.  I haven't even tried co-op or Versus yet but the singleplayer experience is easily above any other Splinter Cell out there and in general is one of the most engaging ones I've played through. The level design, environments, sound direction... everything about the single player is spot on. Hearing the enemies talk to themselves as you creep around with the phenomenal soundtrack really gets you pumped. This is a big step up from the previous two titles. In my opinion, all the other future SC titles strayed too much from its original playstyle and feel, especially at Conviction and Blacklist. While those may appeal more to some people, and may be great games in their own right, they do not come close to offering the most 'Splinter Cell-like' experience as they focus a little more on action. If you're looking for a great stealth game to play try this one out. The environments, the native language feature (which I love) and the fluid animations of Sam really immerse you in the situation, and the soundtrack only makes it better.",1,0

269650,Dex,"For what seemed like such a promising title, when I played Dex it had a distinct feel of a game that wasn't quite finished. That feel that lets the player know that if a little more work was done, then this game would be something great.   Melee combat is a bit of a mess because enemies don't stagger so most of a fight is spent chasing after them. Melee upgrades are mostly combo extenders, but those don't help you because you'll busy chasing after someone who just shrugged off being punched in the head. The dodge roll dodges all melee attacks that I found, and you start the game with it. Cybernetic upgrades are also a bit underwhelming when I saw giant dudes full robot arms punching way harder than I was.  Quests feel buggy and unfinished. There have been points in the game where I found information on a person while just innocently rooting through their apartment, as cyberpunks are known to do. This is information that I did not need yet, and when I talked to a reporter, they told me the trail had gone cold. I went back to check the info again, and talked to the reporter again, and I still couldn't continue with the quest. When this happened it made me afraid to go off the beaten path, that by finding things out of order I could lose more content.  A boss I found was easily the most frustrating experience of the game. Having set myself up for punchy fights, I was told to go punch up some military dudes and their crazy military commander. I ran in to punch them and took a shotgun blast to the teeth. This was no big deal, I wanted to be punchy and the game shouldn't change to fit that. What was a problem was the boss, or rather, the goons that the boss summoned. This goons come from nowhere. I made sure to kill all goons on the way to the bossman, and before fighting him there is a large drop. These goons just walk in from the edge of the screen and start blasting. I couldn't punch out the goons without being shot to death, and if I punched out the boss then the goons would keep shooting while I stood still to talk to him.  A minor grip I had was that no matter where I had the camera, Dex always looked blocky. Fully zoomed in I could count the pixels on Dex's face, fully zoomed out I could count the pixels on Dex's head, even on the default setting for the camera, I could still count the pixels on Dex's face.  All of this put together means I cannot recommend it, which saddens me. The cyberpunk sounded really nice, the story sounded really nice, the characters sounded really cool, but the execution was lacking.",-1,0

It works surprisingly well and while both 2D and 3D leave some poor level design in its wake, it's still a lot of fun - nostalgia or not.  It also looks fantastic on PC.

And even go into space.  My favorite part though is that the airplanes in this game feel real. I've flown in a lot of small aircraft and they have this feel to them that X-Plane 10 simulates very well. FSX just doesn't feel quite right with certain planes, they feel too stiff, or too light.   Also the realism is absolutely top notch. I've played multiplayer which is pretty fun too, and practiced flying in formation, I was suprised that in this game there actually is backwash from jet engines. So you can't fly in someone elses backwash or you will pay the price.  This game also has some weapons put into it, they are difficult to use though, and although they explode they don't really do damage to scenery or anything. They do damage planes but the damage is largely functional not visual.  I have never been thrilled with the helicopters in this game however. I've never been in a helicopter before but they are a real challenge to fly in this game. Whether that's good or bad I'm not quite sure.",1,0

270880,American Truck Simulator,"I was originally really hype for this game. I played so much of Euro Truck Sim 2, so an American version was really exciting. Everything that was in the European version is here, so if you've played ETS before, you'll have no problem skipping all of the tutorials and jumping straight into the game. They added a couple of new features, like choosing your parking difficulty and weigh stations and the lanscapes look exactly like their real life counterparts. They really did their homework in that regard. However, the game was still extremely disappointing. For one, there were only 2 playable states on launch: California and Nevada. This means completing the game is a lot easier and routes tend to be much shorter. I wouldn't mind too much, if it didn't mean traveling on the same highways over and over again because the longest routs usually take you to the same places. The game also only launched with only two trucks too, which is weird because I thought this was called American TRUCK Simulator. I know the lack of trucks was because of licensing issues and they'll be adding more trucks and states later (I believe they already added another truck in an update), but it was still disappointing to see this go a similar route of Sims 4 (a new installation in a franchise with less content than its predecessors). Don't get me wrong though, I still really enjoy what the game had going for it so far, and I've logged quite a few hours into the game already, however, I can't recommend buying it right now since there's not much in it yet. Wait until they add more content, then I really recommend buying it.",-1,1
222750,Wargame: AirLand Battle,"Fun game.. needs work.   Addicting game, but points/timer stuff is crap. Not nearly enough user control over game mechanics in options. It's great you can turn the time limit off... but it doesn't help with the points system kicks in and gives the AI adversery a win. Entirely unrealistic. No... I don't mean unrealistic as in combat. I mean, when you have taken all but the AI enemy's last zone, you have an awesome attack group set up for a final assault, but the AI plinks up enough points to end the battle with only a couple of units left.  Some very annoying other things. Inability to attach units to units. This would be very helpful for those wonderful moments you realize all your AAA (and various other units) has been killed because they took a short cut straight through enemy territory. Would be resolved if you had the option to pick deployment zones. Then there's the odd way YOUR aircraft manage to EVAC right over enemy AAA, oftien right over thier FOB, amost every time. And lets not forget how effortlessly an enemy aircraft machine-guns tanks to death, manage to avoid your anti-air units all while your own aircraft get knocked down by anything that bothers to shoot at them. Otherwise... great fun!! ;)",1,0
400,Portal,"4/5. Portal is insane. I would give it a 5/5, but it's story is really short. It took me less than 2 hours to beat it, so I recommend the bundle. The gameplay from the trailer is completely different and so is the graphics than the actual game. It doesn't have the feel the trailer gives it. On the other hand, It runs 80-120 fps on nearly any machine because it is kind of old but still good. The graphics are very good, the loading doesn't take long, and the gameplay is great. Playing Portal 2, however, makes me miss the double-fling from this one as well as the shape of the Portal Device, which changes in Portal 2(it's a little flatter). Get the both games bundle.",1,0

Its tech-webs are just confusing at first, the battle systems are quite off-putting initially, and the way you conquer a system? Man, quite laughable if you take it at face value.  But I was relentless on learning this game, after all, one can only go so far playing Civilization V. right?   Well, guess what? My last playthroughs I manage to win the games.

233230,Kairo,"Kairo is one of thise gems amongst the steam garbage I seem to keep running into. After playing antichamber, I absoultely had to play Kairo.  Kairo is a game in which you appear to be embarking into the depths of an ancient egypt-like machine that either uses magic or technology too far beyond you to understand. Either way, Kairo is one of those games that doesn't explain anything to you (though you have the option of hints, which don't help much) so it requires a lot of problem solving and logistics on your part.  Most of the puzzles are self-explanitory, and the ones that aren't normally are supplied with a stone or wall you have to look at. Once you find those, you then proceed to facepalm realizing how simple the complex-looking puzzle really is. Even so, the puzzles really are challanging, to the point where I actually had to look up a walkthrough for one of them because it didn't seem to be based on any rhyme or reason (and that I couldn't find any stones or walls to explain it) I'm sure you'll identify the one I'm talking about if you play this game. The story is widely open to interpretation though. There were points in the story that sent a legit chill down my spine. Other moments had me scratching my head wondering what just happened. In order to understand it, you're required to fill in a lot of blanks. Overall, despite it's cheap graphics and oddly slippery controls, Kairo is a game that you'll enjoy figuring out for yourself, and then be proud to finish.",1,1

9940,Blade Kitten,"sorta placeholder review cos i have card idled this game before, i have 4 hours~ on record and 50% of those are now real nonstop played hours. review might get updated once i finish the game. ANYWAY.you know what? it's summer, and this may not be on flash sale but the base game is 75% off right now and if you're looking for a really really fun and fluid intuitive platformer to play and your specs can handle it, then gettit. gettit now.   especially recommend it if you liked the 'flow' of games like TRINE and you like awesome hyped up game BGM, very easy to learn controls that work with whatever you like to control Kit with best (gamepad, mouse and keyboard, keyboard only...) and a n00b-friendly but clearly rapidly escalating difficulty that actually teaches you how to do everything it expects you to do (!) while leaving plenty of room open for exploration and .... pretty much just wow i just spent 2 hours killing goons so i could smash through floors, ceilings, walls and/or climb them, float up them, sprint up them, jump up and down off them, for shiny trinkets and treasure chests so that i could buy Kit a new fashion outfit, knife and a jug of questionable milk, instead of like, i don't know... completing more than a few levels because i was having too much fun exploring AND treasure hunting at the same time.

275850,No Man's Sky,"I wanted to throw my hat in the ring on this one as I feel it is getting a bad rap. I like the game. It is what the original announce said it would be. It is a game about exploring. Go places, look at stuff, kill stuff that is trying to kill you and stay alive doing it all. Follow the limited story, or don't. It is up to you.   That being said, you will be doing a lot of that stuff as of launch month as there is not much else to do other than that. If you are picking this up later on, I am sure there will be some added DLC that will spice things up.  Personally, now that I have put enough time into it. I am going to leave and come back later and give it a shot when there is more to do. It was a fun 50-60 hours though and I feel like I got my moneys worth. That being said, I am mainly the explorer type of gamer so exploring is fun for me.   I am looking forward to whatever they add to the game in the coming months.",1,0

355050,Sky Force Anniversary,"Great Shoot 'Em Up which hits the right balance between grinding for upgrades and fun blowing things up.  Doesn't feel too hardcore with it's 9 stages of varying length for casual fun on «Normal» difficulty, yet offers quite the challenge on «Hard» or «Insane» setting, especially when trying to complete special goals for highscores.  Upgrade paths are pretty straight-forward and limited in a good way. There is only one ship, and basically a single, no-spread, gun weapon. Would have liked some better in-game explanation on the consumable weapons and its upgrades (laser, shields, mega bomb) though, which should not be your first upgrade choice, but they are only necessity in mid to end-game stages.  Mouse Input is a bit awkward to begin with, but offers more precision in some cases. There is an undocumented way to change the key bindings by starting into the Unity(?)-launcher by holding Left-Alt key pressed while launching the game from Steam.  Overall it's highly recommended.

A new strategic option has been added with the Thrones of Ascension which allows one to tweak the play style of the game in a large way during set-up. The civilizations available have been expanded, and an option for team play has been introduced with the Disciple mechanic. A word to the wise, this is a deep game with a steep learning curve and a lot of subtle mechanics which strongly effect gameplay.

The plot becomes increasingly linear, and the choices given to you have zero effect on what's to come. In a meer 4-5 hours the story has lost all sense of purpose and ends on an extremely dull note. By the end of the game you're left awstruck, as to why you purchased the game in the first place.   By all means purchase this game if you wish to walk along a path for a few hours.

351450,Scribble Space,"There isn't much to say about this game so I was going to write up a short list of pros and cons to sum it all up, but after a few moments of consideration I realized that there were no 'pros' to share.  The game is cheap, especially so on sale. I picked Scribble Space up for half a dollar hoping it would be a short, casual sidescrolling shooter I could play through without much effort. Now that I've played it a short while, I know that if this game were freely available online, I would not have played it for more than a few seconds. Since I paid for it I felt inclined to at least get my money's worth, but this is one of the few times I have legitimately regretted a purchase on Steam. Again, it wasn't much money in the first place, but this game is much more frustrating than it is fun.  Though the concept is simple, the gameplay issues are too frequent and obvious to overlook. The player hitbox isn't made clear, which makes creatively designing your own ship more dangerous to the gameplay than it is fun. Taking damage removes all your power ups, and this really wouldn't be a problem if the hitbox made more sense. Even then, though, it is almost impossible to avoid taking damage in this game, rendering you without the power ups (which are rare as it is) for the majority of the time playing. Boss fights are a nightmare to deal with, and it isn't always obvious what you are supposed to be attacking or how to even avoid taking damage. Most of the time you have to hope to just get lucky and get enough shots in to defeat the boss before you die.  The game has cards and achievements, so if you want it for either of those then go ahead. Be warned, though, that one achievement requires a lot of luck and mastery of the game, so you may spend quite a bit of time playing it if you want to 100% it.",-1,0

20920,The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,"The Witcher franchise, as a whole, has garnered rather favorable reception from critics, with its apex widely considered to be the recently released Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt. Now, I personally have strayed from the Witcher franchise for no particular reason, just a general disinterest I suppose. I enjoy the fantasy genre and RPGs, so why wouldn’t the Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings be able to saunter onto my radar and come out being considered a fantastic piece of game? Well, with over 23 hours of this game under my belt, I have many choice words for this games favor, as well as many for is developers to mull over.  The first thing that you notice and will eventually salivate over is how great this game actually looks, especially how color filled it is. Thankfully The Witcher 2 has fallen prey to the better side of gamings trend toward better graphics without having everything doused in dank browns and greys like many other titles. You’ll often just sit back and enjoy what a visual spectacle that has been prepared for you, hair swaying, tassels bouncing on the character, flora flowing with the winds; everything blends together to make such a believable visual style that manages to remain all its own. In terms of graphical and aesthetic prowess, The Witcher 2 can stand toe to toe with any of the next gen releases, and even come out on top in many areas.  While the game is very pretty, the story, while set in world of rich history and believability, leaves much to be desired. Maybe it is because I lack the investment from the first game, but the stakes never feel like they should. I mean, further down the line your to repel a ♥♥♥♥ing invasion; the unfortunate thing being is that the whole thing is turned into essentially Horde mode, beat one wave after another to progress in the story. I mean this happens a lot in many situations if not all, this “kill everyone to progress to the next level” mentality. Even when you kill a ♥♥♥♥ING DRAGON, the thing is easier than the first boss in the ♥♥♥♥ING GAME. The characters also feed into this tone, as, while the voice actors try, I kinda get the feeling they were only performing at half their capacity as they don’t pump the player for any major plot events as they should.  Still, even if the the events of the story lack weight, the decisions do. Im sure if you were to replay the game again, the decisions would feel less dynamic and spontaneous, but that's what they felt like. As if I could’ve chosen a different path and wildly change the outcome of things, creating a real tension when you do have to make these choices. Some are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t though, like when you are given the choice to help someone who busted you from prison or give a sword to someone who is aiding you tracking a kingslayer, with the ultimate decision having either character you chose tag along with you the rest of the game. Still, while story lackluster, the decisions are weight filled and consequential, to a tad of a fault in some instances.  Combat is a mixed bag. First, praise should be given to how layered it is, as you could increase damage dealt with various oils, potions and trophies. This kind of complexity will be sure to get you out of a tight jam more than you realize, especially early game. While layered, this complexity seems to become irrelevant later down the line, as you’ll have more powerful equipment that will compensate the damage you couldn’t deal prior, at earlier levels. Magic is also thrown into the mix, but with mixed results as you will make the most use out of one, Aarnd, which essentially force pushes opponents. Despite how seeming layered the combat is, I hate how the leveling system is incredibly lopsided, favoring basic melee attacks over the other mechanics. The melee combat is still rather good, though a little variance in leveling would be nice, as alchemy and magic become underutilized in late game, hurting you more than you think.  Complementing the combat was the surprising amount of enemy variety. You got scores of different monsters and scores of different types of men to fight. You’ll face harpies, knights, zombie-like things, crossbowmen, insectoids, and much much more. Each enemy has specific fighting patterns you can utilize to your advantage or suffer for naught, it all feels very dynamic and satisfying when you blow through a horde with only sliver of you life bar remaining. Bosses are a bit anticlimactic though. There was this huge build up a some point to fight this giant fire demon, who died in like ten hits. I wish more challenge was brought here as with the other enemies.  So, is The Witcher 2 a good game? Yes. Is it the best RPG I’ve ever played? No. While much of the game is rather great, and it presents itself rather well, these little minor hindrances here and there bring down what could’ve been a rather fantastic game. If these problems were fixed, maybe this game would rank highly with me, easily one of my favorite games of all time even. But sadly, that isn’t the case.   Verdict   7/10  Good",1,0

248410,Legends of Aethereus,"cannot recommend as of the latest build this should be noted that this is closed to open beta then a full release as many systems in the game are not fuctional.  the melee combat is very close to the original fable just not as good. single handed weapons dont have any sort of combat system and while there are 'power attacks' it is not mentioned anywhere in the tutorial (which never goes away). while there are directional attacks from movement they are situational and dont work that well unless you know exactly how to use them. many times for any attack i swing and my character will walk past the enemy swinging uselessly. ranged combat works rather well with the exception that while aiming you cannot move (as of the build i am using). as well that your cursor moves rather slowly. the skill system is a standard reagent system, you use items to use your skills. some of the skills from the two classes work really well but there seems to be an amount of randomness about some of the abilities, for example a skill for one of the classes builds a turret that you have to control this is mentioned nowhere in the skill system. another issue with combat is that your character cannot run when having a weapon drawn this is in contrast to your enemies which can and they will take advantage of this swarming you at time sunless your aim is good.  the leveling system while not inspired works well. with an amount of points given towards physical stats and a point for skill. its a fairly standard system that could use more explanation in the game. there are 6 stats with 3 in opposition so you cant have max strength and max speed. these stats also affect your ability to carry things, your aim time, and attack strength.  the thing i was looking forward to in the game was the crafting system whihc breakes down weapons and armore into their base components which you can select which material to build with. the major issure with this is that i have built the best weapon on can within the first half hour of the game and i have yet to run into the materials to build a better weapon which is rare and hard to get from any of the vendors. the designs for the weapons are nice and with the rifles pistols and crossbows it is mention you can have multiple barrels. this is not implemented yet.  if the game was more finished, they fixed the combat system, and varied up the effects fo the different crafting materials i could recomment it but as of the current build i cannon.",-1,0
214560,Mark of the Ninja,"Very well done, and maybe the best stealth gameplay depth in a game to date. If you think you'd like MGS or Hitman style action in a sidescroller package, you've found your game. Certianly worth the bus fare of a humble bundle's price, worth it at retail, but as its perpetual sale bait, just wait for it to pop up in one and vote for lower prices with a purchase, they can sweat it out its Microsoft partnered. Hope the same quality is bulit into 'Deadlight', which looks like its cousin.

235340,NA,"I will be honest. In the beginning, it was doing well. Their was a imbalance of heroes(sesha/Blademaster, brawler for example), and matchmaking was decent. Now this game has been a shadow of its former self.   The introduction of the orange talents ruined the game, some heroes are broken and unkillable, or too OP. Worst of all, the devs in their grand wisdom, decided to merge russians to Eu and NA servers, thus creating a disaster. Not only do you deal with russians that are atrocious, but will purposely feed. One game, my friend and I had to deal with russian players feeding, not because we told him he sucked, not because he is trolling, but because of our nationality(america). This happened so many times, that i was forced to use any flag close to or friends with russia. No matter how many times on the forums we complained about the merge, the devs and admin did nothing.   Now this game is so bad, that the factions are now merged together, and instead of fixing some of the heroes that need a nerf, they buffed them to be nearly godlike. If you are new, hahaha, good luck, as you will be slaughtered instantly. No matter how well your team may work together, they will lose to 1 orange talented player. And i have a orange talented player and i just simply carried my team to a W. So this is no longer a game of skill or thinking. Its more of, 'I play really bad but my talents will carry me to victory.' And yes, there are playes with orange talents that play so bad, but their talents and time spent on this game carries them. Unless, you waant to spend 15-20 bucks to get talents, then you're good to go.   This game gets a 4/10. Unbalanced heroes, talents that are broken and completely stupid, the castle and gathering resources and its quest are decent, and devs that support RU&gt;NA and EU.",-1,0
4560,Company of Heroes - Legacy Edition,"Highly recommended as this is one of the best RTS of the past decade. Pick it up along with the first DLC - opposing fronts, since it adds a ton of contents and replay value. The game also contains a very vibrant online community and a ton of maps that can be played against human opponents or in co-op against the AI, which can be very competent and challenging.  Avoid the Tales of Valor DLC unless it's bundled together with the game.",1,0

222480,Resident Evil Revelations,"Well i played this title right after RE6. so wanna compare it to that game which most ppl call 'action' more than 'survival horror'.  This one has many better things than RE6 and is more like the old RE games that we all used to play when we were young. so here we have a rich and deep story with a ridiculously happy ending. we have the classic RE specs which most locations are connected to eachother and instead of A to B thing that RE6 is all about....its some kind of openworld to me as u can go back to previous locations and experience new things. like oldschool ones, u have to collect items, solve puzzles and the most important one....open doors :D other thing is that u cant slide or run like the way u do in RE6. the result is that it takes more effort to kill bosses and u have to dodge which is harder than RE6 counter-attacking as it has no indicator when to press key. and one bad thing......zombies are almost the same. if u ignore 4-5 bosses, other enemies are not that much different. another con....no chapter selection. although u have some slots which u can save on when u end each chapter. and last one....i wish enemies in raid mode had random spawn points. that way it could be waaaay more challenging. anyway, that raid mod ROCKS! btw, i think this game is much better than RE6-singleplayer. more classic more pure and better story so i doubt u can stop playing campaign before reaching the end. wish it had gore and also RE6 multiplayer modes (which are its strongest point) too. UPDATE: after almost 250 hours of gameplay, the game still has more things (parts and weapons) to show up in raid mode. so still im playing :D",1,1

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Admittedly, I have not read any of The Witcher novels or even played any of the previous Witcher games. I watched a 'movie' of The Witcher 2's cut scenes stitched together to get a general understanding of what makes the universe and what is going on before the third game.   As soon as I played it I was sucked in. There is quite a lot of controversy among certain groups about The Witcher 3's graphical down grade. While that it is true that the graphics aren't as beautiful as the footage shown in 2013/2014, The Witcher 3 is a very beautiful game. With the latest patches and ini tweaking you can make it look fantastic.   What is more beautiful than the graphics of the game, are the stories told. There is so much lore in this world and it isn't beaten over your head. You can learn a lot by reading notes, books, speaking with various NPCs. The choices you make in the game can matter. Not necessarily to you but to other NPCs. Most don't even take effect immediately. I made some decisions in my story that didn't take effect until 10-15 hours later!    I was completely sucked into this game. The music, graphics, stories, everything, is all so fantastic that I powered through all of the side quests and main story to see how it concludes. While I love it all I wish I didn't just so I could savor every last morsel.      While the game is amazing, it isn't quite perfect though. Inventory management can be a pain in the ♥♥♥. You can't store any of your loot in a separate location (at least not at the time of this review). I had to reload save points from time to time because quests weren't triggering properly. CDPR is pretty on the ball with patches and a new one is coming out soon that'll fix some of these issues but not all of them. Quite a few glitches from time to time. Just Google The Witcher 3 glitches and see the list.   What's weird is all of those issues would normally hamper my final review of the game but I just can't fault it. With as large as this world is, you expect there to be some hiccups. CDPR is working actively to fix those problems and have sworn to back the game for the next 2 years.  Solid recommendation. My favorite single player game.",1,0

225020,Tomb Raider (VI): The Angel of Darkness,"Tomb Raider: Angel Of Darkness. I still can't believe that i put 15 hours into it just to get all the items and access all the areas of the game (Since some decisions can change your pathway, witch actually was the only cool thing in this game).  The change of graphics of Tomb Raider was good, but i remember playing for the first time a long time ago. If you don't know how to config the graphics or isn't using the last patched version (Witch is Steam one), ohohoho. IT HAD SO MUCH GRAPHICAL GLITCHES. And the most updated product does still have theses glitches there and there...But i remember beating it for the first time, my eyes HURT.  Gameplay was AWFUL. Lara is slow and i swear to god that she wasn't supposed to jump THAT high. It's almost useless trying to make perfect jumps because you just can't. You will be trying over and over until you get it right. And that can kill your immersion, for example, in places like the temples of fire, earth, air and water.  The story is just....Well, actually plot isn't so bad. I don't actually like the changes do Lara's behavior, she could do anything in this game without begin rude as she was. Old Lara wasn't rude, but sarcastic. And that was her touch. That's why she is one of the best female protagonists of games. TRAOD just kill this personality of Lara. That's the only thing that i don't like of the plot. If you read Vernom notes and explore the games, they actually give nice details about the origin of many things, letting us think that they actually put some effort on making the game story, witch is cool. The other thing that bothers me are the characters. Aside from Kurtis, i just can't remember anyone that i wanted to know his or her story. Most of them are boring and killing Werner was bad idea. If he at least was alive, it could be so much better. Kurtis' story is mostly unknown. By the end of the game, we don't really know much about him, besides that his dad was killed by the bad guys and he wants vengeance. The cliffhanger ending however blows this fact. We don't know if Kurtis was who he really was or if it was something else. This game, for whose don't know, was supposed to be a trilogy (Thank God that din't happen) and that cliffhanger ending was supposed to be where the next game would start. Then Legend happened (Thank God, again).  Aside from menu music and some others, it's quite forgetable. Since most of it is a constant loop of suspense themes. And there are sounds re-used from Tomb Raider 5. Voice in this game isn't bad. Lara's voice is actually great, and so are others. Actually i think i only like Eckard (IDK if his name is spelled like this) as a villain because of his voice. The only voice that i din't liked was Boraz.  There are two things that i liked in this game: Level Design and exploration. Level design actually is pretty good. I like the part of the temples and how we go through then. If only jump was a little lower, maybe these areas would be pleasurable to play. Most of the part of the game is in Paris, but it don't gets to repetitive since there are new places to explore. And exploration, different from other games, is not as much reward-full, but it will always gets you ammo or health. Water levels were a cool thing too. I missed then from Tomb Raider 2 and 4. This game was designed to have multiple choices, so you could get to new areas or don't get anywhere are all (Yes, there ARE choices that kill you, wonderful). It's was a nice touch, dialogue choices and different pathways was never introduced on Tomb Raider until this game. And this feature was completely forget since this one. I would really like to see it again, since most actual games now have multiple pathways and endings. Maybe because this game was bad (Or din't had any extra ending at all) they decided to never use it again. That's sad.  If there are two things that i ABSOLUTELY HATED about this game was: Money and selling. You can use your money to bet it with other people (Witch actually is just one person in a church, lol) or to subordinate (Witch, again, i only saw begin used in this way one time. The journalist that says 'Your credit runned out' will always says this not matter how much money you have). There two methods of getting money: Finding it or selling goodies that you find through the game. SELLING IS USELLES. All the money that you find is enough to bet it and win (Because you can save before betting it) AND to subordinate people (SINCE IT'S ONLY ONE). So, if i can't buy weapons or anything, WHY ARE GOODIES HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE? And there's more! If you don't sell all the goodies before the trader gets killed (YES! THE TRADER DIES!), YOU CAN'T SELL IT ANYMORE! YOU WILL HAVE TO CARRY USELESS ITEMS UNTIL THE END OF THE FREAKING GAME! JESUS CHRIST, WHY?! WHY DID WE NEED THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE?! ISN'T LARA, LIKE, RICH? Can't she pay them with her own money? Or, if she can't right now, give something that she will remember and pay them later?  Or else? Couldn't she just avoid all this game's story if she payed an advocate? Seriously, guard just started chasing her think she was The Moustrum WITH NO PROOFS AT ALL. They put DEADLY DOGS to chase her. Damn. I know they believe she committed a murder. But what about paralyzing? Can't they just put her to sleep or something? What about THE FREAKING MANY TIMES SHE SAVED THE WORLD? ARE THEY JUST GOING TO, LIKE, FORGET IT?! AND CHASE HER NO MATTER WHAT AND WITHOUT PROOFS?! And i'm still wanting to know how the police find out about the assassination in the first place. Did Eckard called they? Or something? God, why this game had to happen in the first place?  0/10. Will. Never. Play. Again. Thank God for new reboot on Tomb Raider, witch was awesome.",-1,0

303210,The Beginner's Guide,"I was so excited for this game, especially upon hearing that it was made by the mastermind that created 'The Stanley Parable'. When I started playing it, I enjoyed the fact that it played a lot like Stanley, but after a few minutes, I realized that the game was moving incredibly slowly and I really wasn't doing anything in the game except walking. I figured that the game was building up to something and eventually it would speed up.  It never did. This is game is literally nothing but visiting different unfinished game worlds, listening to a story and walking. So much walking. So it's basically The Stanley Parable but with all the fun stuff taken out. Don't play this game unless you're fine playing a completely uninteresting game with no challenges and a boring story. It's not worth the money and although some people may appreciate it for being 'deep and artsy', it's also flat and boring and wasn't for me.",-1,0

264200,One Finger Death Punch,"One finger death punch caught me completely off guard.  I expected a casual time waster and what I got was a somewhat shallow but very solid and entertaining two button fighting game. This game is much more difficult to play in later levels than it may initially appear from screenshots and trailers.  This game might bring much nostalgia to you if you were around Newgrounds during the days that Xiao Xiao was really popular, because this is very much a spiritual successor to it.   It has a nice learning curve and is easy to pick up but somewhat difficult to truly master. For completionists out there, you might like the fact that it has a medal system. While it may seem easy to get a platinum medal for the first few missions, the difficulty ramps up with each campaign mission. Here's where my one and only complaint with the game comes from. While it occasionally varies it's many missions up with laser sword, crash, and numchuck missions, after a short while of playing it can feel very samey. Which isn't a bad thing because the game is addictive as all hell, but you might want to play in short bursts for maximum enjoyment.   For $5? This game is definitely worth it, it's highly entertaining, replayable and very addictive. A survival mode in any game for me is a huge plus and this game has three different kinds of survival modes (Well, technically two, the third one is just regular survival with a   giant cat   obscuring one side of your screen), one of which tests your game knowledge by taking away all visual cues except for enemy color.

The main problem i have with the game is the way the questions are asked. Instead of simply asking you who directed this and who was in that or what scene is this from. It has to ask you question in some nonsensical way. like 'In the movie Airplane, Jimmy is asked if he has seen a grown man naked. Who would he see naked in the directors other movies'. Its actually a trick question since that movie had 3 directors. Also i got really annoyed by the narrator constant sarcasm. That alone gives me a reason not to play this again.",-1,0
403640,Dishonored 2,"Okay, this game now far more playable for me. I run this game on i5 4590 @3.3GHz, GTX 1070, 8gb ram at 1080p resolution and mostly ultra setting. I've gather some tweaks that I've read on some guides, discussions, or wherever it is, and here is what I do:  On nVidia control panel manage 3D setting under Program Settings option I've add Dishonored 2(dishonored2.exe) program and change its Maximum pre-rendered frames to 1, Single display performance mode and Prefer maximum performance.  Then I change in game visual setting to borderless fullscreen mode, triple buffering on, adaptive resolution off, v-sync on and always alt+tab to desktop then back to game first before I jump in to campaign. And the result is just satisfying enough for me. Less frame pacing (which I hate the most than FPS drops), and also less stuttering. Now I got 60 FPS rarely drop to 56-57.  I hope this could be help for you guys who had same PC specs as me or even better than mine and sorry for my bad english and messy explanation.",1,0

377160,Fallout 4,"Just because you're having fun with a game doesn't mean you're willing to recommend it to anyone.  Fallout 4 is the first game to keep me entertained consistantly for a long time and that said I still wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it to anyone.  The short of it is that the performance of the game, the graphic quality, the sound effects and the ability to customize it are seriously lacking and personally I don't enjoy the setting or the story.  Also a lot of the content keeps getting reused, for instance in any previous Bethesda RPG if you joined a faction they would give you tailored missions that fit in with the lore of the faction and tied into the main story for that faction but in Fallout 4 so far for me its been either 'go here and kill everything' or 'go here and kill everything and pick something up' leading up to a plot mission with no build up.  I have other issues with Fallout 4 but I won't go into depth with them, the're little things like wondering why the AI doesn't seem to have been updated much or why the sound levels seem so messed up and its hard to hear whats around me, why the graphics are so bad, performance issues, lack of controlable options like FoV, etc..  Theres still plenty about Fallout 4 that is great but it doesn't feel like enough effort was put into the game, as if a few design departments were continuously 'out-to-lunch', so if anyone ever asked if I would recommend Fallout 4 my answer would be 'No, but you might like it'.   I worry if I only like Fallout 4 because I haven't played a main-stream game I enjoyed in so long...",-1,1
242920,Banished,"Let's get some technical questions out of the way. The User Interface is fluid. The game is responsive. The attention to detail is astounding. When you build farms, you don't just have a farm, you are allowed to choose between a dozen food types. Your main resources are wood, stone, iron, coal. Which you harvest in familiar ways. The options are what stand out to me in this game. Other simulations might have you build farms for every 10 people or some other fixed value. In Bansihed you have choices. Lots of choices. Lots and Lots of choices. You might start the game only knowing how to farm squash. But everntually you will be able to have over a dozen fruits, vegetables, and meats to choose from. You have farms, in the typical fashion, but you have orchards now. This allows your brewer to use any fruits, or wheat to make ales. You have fruit and nut trees. You have over a dozen food choices to from. Corn, pumpkin, squash, wheat, beans, and more. Easily worth the $20 i dropped on it. I missed it on sale for 15 by a few hours. Already have 20 hours in the game. So at $1 an hour, well worth the investment, and I'm just getting started.",1,0

232010,Euro Truck Simulator,"This game is very addictive, now you might be asking 'Random person on the internet, how the hell is trucking across europe addictive?' It's becuase your able to explore, now this games map isn't like the crew and driving across one side to the other is a small 148 KM that lasts maybe 30 mins or 50 mins, this game map is huge, and I haven't even drove through most of it, but if a simple drive haul from Poland to Vienna takes maybe an hour or so depending if your low on fuel or you are too tired to go and and need to rest, this game is pretty big, another thing is that it's a simualtor, that means that this game is somewhat trying to be the real thing, so running red lights, hitting traffic, and (basicly trying to go as fast as the AI is) is bad, oh and if your still reading this look in the controls before you go and drive, so overall I reccomend it for people who have a computer too crappy to play Euro Truck Simualtor 2, or someone who needs a game they can play when they are bored, or someone who has 8$ and dosen't know what to buy, my general rating would be an 8/10.

255710,Cities: Skylines,"My specs: Lenovo Y580, gtx 660M, i7-3630QM @2.4GHz,   I should mention I'm not a big city builder fan, past exp has been some simcity game 20yrs ago and er...Theme Hospital XD.  Pro: + No online/server/login problems; + Easy to pickup and start building; + Vehicles don't suddenly disappear, you can follow them to their destination; + Great attention to detail, can name anything from people, vehicles, buildings, etc; + Great visuals, can zoom in/out and follow vehicles; + Not overcomplicated with stats, graphs, etc; + Relaxing game, no disasters or anything trying to ruin your city; + Mods/Workshop, Map and Asset editor already added; + Freedom to build simple or insanely complex road system; + Just a well developed game;  Cons: - Needs a fast machine to enjoy graphics; - Might not be enough depth for hardcore sim builders; - Will eat a lot of yr time; - No wind pollution;  Colossal Order have done a great job in creating a great city builder. There is a huge amount of content already in the base game. Deluxe edition doesn't contain much in game enhancements but if you have the money and don't mind showing your appreciation you should. They have put in everything from the basics of water and elec to build complex road systems, residential, commercial, industry, trains, planes, farms, forestry, hospital, fire stations, police, cemetery.....the list goes on. You can have numerous bus lines, color code each line and the actual bus color changes accordingly!! Fantastic attention to detail. More importantly its all done in a non-complicated and enjoyable experience.  You can't change what a farm grows or how big each building is, you manage the overview of a complete city. The main focus is on building an efficient road system. It'll be very difficult to fail if you can do that, but being able to raise/lower roads you can build insanely complex road systems or be as simple as you like and build a quiet little town.  A very well polished game, haven't encountered any bugs or crashes. Everything works as you'd expect it. A slow sense of achievement/attachment to your city as it grows. It's great to be able to zoom right in, hear the sounds of city life and just watch.",1,0

You explore the bottom of the sea while collecting resources and crafting various items to allow for deeper exploration and crafting. Eventually you can start up a sort of hard mode by messing with some of the stuff out in the deeper ocean but I don't want to spoil it too much so I'll leave it at that.

208140,ENDLESS™ Space - Definitive Edition,"Before I review this I believe a bit of my background as a gamer is needed. Among the first games I started playing were the Command &amp; Conquer games (they were SO good, until Zero Hour.. Then it went downhill), so I have experience with fast paced RTS's. I also have sunk many hours into Alpha Centauri, which is more of a 4X/Civ building game. I have played games such as Rise of Nations, Empire Earth, Age of Empires, and many other Strategy games. Now I feel like I know a good Strategy game when I see one, and let me tell you this one of those good ones. Endless Space is a great game for those of you that are 4X/CIv Building fans (not so much for the faster paced RTS fans though you may still enjoy it with the game speed cranked up). If you liked Alpha Centauri, and games like it, you will likely love this game (it is not as in-depth compared to Alpha Centauri too). So far I have sunk 40+ hours into the game (playing on normal speed, so that's only been 1 completed game and 2 that I have yet to complete). I have only played as 3 races thus far. The Sowers have been my favorite of the ones I have played as, they seem the most balanced and have a great late game ship class. The other races I played as, the Siphons and Sherydn (not sure on the spelling of those two), didn't seem as well balanced but are still very playable. Graphically and soundtrack wise the game is great too. I have had a few minor bugs (ship health being displayed incorrectly and one of my fleets derping out) but they were not too bad. As I said, just minor bugs.  Overall, it seems like a well put together game. If you're a fan of Alpha Centauri or games like it, get this for sure. I got the game on a Steam Sale, but I would have payed full price for it. It is well worth 30 dollars. Sorry, about the long review. Again, my main point is if you are a strategy fan and want a good space/sci-fi game then get this!",1,0

205100,Dishonored,"What can I say about this game? The most common trait of all stealth games, are bad controls: either unresponsive, or overly sensitive; where the slightest movement will slap you in the face. I have found this to be true with every stealth game I have ever played, especially with older games, with more or less outdated control schemes. It is best as I can define to be a law of stealth games, with but a few loopholes. This game is one rare exception to that law I have found playing in other stealth games, and it does suffer from sensitivity at times, it has proven well enough to be a competent stealth game with very redeeming gameplay quality, however, the single player only experience does have limits on the replay value at times, it is always a good game where you can just enter, and start playing. The story of this game goes on the semi-traditional form of a steampunk world that has mutated itself into a complex, and unique genre different to that of the direct normality of steampunk. Instead of steam power, and brass bronzish colors you get whalepunk. A completely different punk styling for a game. Everything including the characters look like water art from an old victorian painting, with english undertones of a nautical society. The technology which is what centers around a punk world is also done differently.   Dieselpunk- steelish colors, and war filled undertones, and out of the first two world wars.   Atompunk- flashy colors, and styles of old cheesy science fiction movies such as fallout, the jetsons, and forbidden planet in design.   Biopunk- Set in the world of biological manipulation, and all the gruesome horror of concept  Cyberpunk- The classic genre that started it all, neon colors, and revolves around cybernetics, and robotics.   (This genre) Whalepunk- Blued steel, nautical victorian style buildings, and everything being powered by whale oil.   Now I feel this game to be a little short. The ball's moment stops with a hard crash, and is very sudden. If you want a good stealth game? It is a good game. If you want a combat oriented game? It is also very good. Just be sure to remember the game ends very quickly, at least for me. The characters are okay, with the Lord Protector Corvo being the weakest in my opinion.

335000,Tormentum - Dark Sorrow,"I'll start off by saying I really don't want to give this a thumbs down, but unfortunately Steam doesn't have a 'On the fence' button. So instead I'll just cut to the chase.  VISUALS: -If you enjoy dark fantasy and surreal art- the gothic, the baroque, the grotesque- GET THIS GAME. - If you like art in games, hope to make art for games, or just like creativity in games and want inspiration- GET THIS. - If you're a fan of Giger or Beksinski, DEFINITELY GET THIS GAME.   I don't really have to go into detail on this. The screenshots speak for themselves.   LENGTH:  The game is very short. This is a 3 to 4 hour game, sans any mucking about in confusion. Not really a detriment in its own right, but definitely a factor to consider.  GAMEPLAY/PUZZLES:  The game isn't challenging. I can't remember the last time I played a point and click game, but I still breezed through this. This could be seen as a blessing for casual players just looking to experience the art firsthand, but I'm certain it would be underwhelming for any seasoned point-and-click fan.   WRITING:  It's lackluster. It's not awful, but considering what the game was trying to do it needed to do much better here. I'll avoid spoilers but it’s important to know that the writing in the game is inseparable from moral choice. The story, the theme and the visuals of the game ultimately revolve around death, sins, punishment and things not being what they seem. This could have been incredible, but for a game so trenched in morality, it is portrayed as very black and white.   There are two endings to this game and around 7 moral choices you must make. They're fairly rudimentary , and even doing two perceived 'bad' choices will give you the bad ending. Morality is very complicated and needs to be handled as such if your whole story hinges on exploring these themes. Games like Silent Hill 2, Spec Ops: The Line and The Walking Dead all accomplished this with flying colors, and had that quality of writing gone into a game like this the end result would have been haunting. Of this I have no doubt.  As it stands however, the end result is this world of beautiful visuals and unsettling atmosphere that winds up being in the service of a lot of nothing. If you're looking for a great story, interesting characters or strong worldbuilding (particularly revolving around morality and the darkness in the human heart), you will be disappointed.   OVERALL:  I bought the game on impulse and my choice to buy it was exclusively rooted in the artwork. I didn't go in with any other expectations so personally, I'm happy with what I got out of it and do no regret anything. But I cannot say with confidence that this would be the case with somebody else so I leave it at this:   If you came here for the art- go for it. An art book or ticket to a gallery show or museum often cost way more than 12$, and here the art is interactive. That's just awesome. You can't do much better than that.   Just don't expect much else from it.",-1,0

Using this character you will kill enemies to gain power-ups with various effects such as increased attack speed, damage, movement speed, and defensive effects. There are also drones that you can repair scattered around the levels which will follow you and either heal you or do damage to enemies. These drones also take damage and can be destroyed leaving them sitting on the ground needing to be repaired again. Other characters are unlockable as well by completing certain criteria shown in the game.   I highly recommend picking up this title.",1,0

I would like to spare but I had 0 canned food but over 10 vegetables and raw food. Dafuq? take my veggies! Game fix it. 2) after 3 runs and over 15 hours of gameplay I realized that my max survivors will always be four. I would like to have 6 or 8 survivors. 3) Implement Multiple Scavengers: either having two guys sent to scavenge one place to cover each other like in real life or sent in different places to scavenge with one off-screen. 4) A murderer or bandit should not feel guilty and sad each time after a wrong doing.

In this game you have the exact opposite problem. The landscapes are enormous and breath taking, with the only problem that you may wander for long time before realizing you'll never get anywhere this way. This is definitely a game to be played with a finger perpetually hovering over the F12 key so that you can take a screenshot. And believe me, you'll take a LOT of screenshots. The levels are simply stunning.  As for the gameplay, the rumors are true. This is not an easy nor forgiving game. However, if you've had your fair share of experience with first person games that require jumping, then you'll be probably okay with this one. During my play I only had to check a video walkthrough once (during the ending) to see where I should go, and I only had a near rage-quit moment during the levels with the fans and air ducts. Be patient and you'll succeed. But most importantly, remember that the scenario that awaits at the end of each challenge is totally worth the tears and effort!  A hard game, but a gorgeous one. Really, really gorgeous one. I'm still struck by it.",1,0

233550,Another World,"Looking for the DEFINITIVE version of this game? This isn't really it. I would reccomend the Sega CD version over this. Heart of the Alien isn't a very good game (and was made without Eric Chahi I think), but it's there. Never played this before? This port is decent enough, but it's short, and you will probably dislike the game for the puzzles being really obtuse compared to modern games. It is difficult to suspend disbelief storywise that the main character did exactly everything he had to do without dying, from to all the sidetracking to get past unforseeable deathtraps.  PROS: -The new HD backgrounds are pretty, though sometimes looking hastily made on closer inspection. -Comes with the Sega CD version's soundtrack (Though so does the Sega CD version, since they're just tracks on the disc, and the Sega CD version includes Heart of the Alien soundtrack which is just more of that) -Plays as it should. The game is Another World. They didn't George-Lucas-Special-Edition-up the gameplay/story or anything.  -New Hard Mode adds some new surprises for people who played older versions to death like I have. -No need for passwords. There's now a scene select with actual names for the different 'levels'  CONS: -Plenty of glitches. I found about 6 different ones in less than an hour of play. The achievements are especially glitched, but the most annoying is probably the cursor vanishing until you restart the whole program if you have the pause menu mapped to a controller button and press it twice in succession. -No music during gameplay. Eric Chahi prefers it without, but come on, man. Let me choose. I grew up with ports that did have music and was looking forward to seeing what soundtrack this version used. -HD mode is extremely polygonal. For example: The workers in the background of the first screen of the prison are entirely made up of sharp rhombuses. The corner of Lester's lower leg often juts out from behind the knee. While standard definition mode is really pixellated, sprites come off a little more organic, especially when the pixel edges were masked by the blur of an SD CRT monitor/TV back in the day. I'd say 'The sprites in this game looked better in SD on a CRT' is a pretty major con for an HD re-release.  Who should get this:  Old fans who need to own every version or have no access to any other legal means of playing it. Or if your fondest memories are of the Amiga version (since you can effectively make it just like it).",-1,0

207750,Symphony,"Symphony is a Shoot ‘Em Up with your music library as soundtrack - obviously the best soundtrack possible ;). I got to admit, that I’m quite unfamiliar with the genre of Shoot ‘Em Ups, so keep this in mind when I criticize the gameplay.  The engine of this game generates levels out of your music library. So the same song, on the same difficulty level, will always play out the same. This engine works really good. The intensity of the song reflects directly in the gameplay (and visuals). The aggressiveness of enemies changes with the intensity of the song. The intensity level is always in relation to the song, so even high-speed heavy metal songs have phases of “slower” gameplay and less aggressive enemies. Enemies enter the “battlefield” according to the rhythm of the song, fire their weapons accordingly and their general speed changes with the intensity of the song. The art style is gorgeous, in my opinion. The bright neon colours reflect the intensity of the song and enemies. The problem with this reduced art style is that enemy projectiles can be hard to see on the red background. And I felt sometimes like the game just randomly killed me. Especially on harder difficulties, when a lot of enemies race around the screen, the game can get really confusing and even frustrating. At times there are so many enemies on the screen that there is almost no room to navigate any more. This, however, is a problem exclusive to the higher difficulties. As I said before, this might be due to my inexperience with this genre. After all I got ( and still get) a lot of fun out of this game. On lower difficulties it’s just beautiful to see the engine at work and it is definitely fun as hell to shoot your way through your favourite songs.",1,0

317510,Beyond Gravity,"I don't recommend this game for three reasons. One, not enough variety; two, the shop prices feel too high; three, there's little sense of risk.  The gameplay involves jumping from planet to planet while collecting screws and dodging fireballs that travel up and down. That's a nice foundation, but it's all there is. If you can line yourself up and time your jumps properly, you can go on for dozens of minutes in a single run and not see anything new besides planets, screws, and the occasional group of fireballs. It would have been nice to see different types of obstacles, planets, or powerups, especially once you survive past the first few minutes.  My first run lasted around twenty minutes, and I managed to collect around 10,000 screws. Not bad, right? Actually, that was barely enough to buy the cheapest item at the shop, and all it did was increase my jump speed slightly. Many items cost at least 30,000 screws, which equates to at least an hour of playtime at my speed. When you consider how repetitive the gameplay can be, that feels way too long.  There are optional challenges you can complete, but I've gone through around 25% of them, and so far the payouts don't seem to exceed 1,000 - 2,000 screws. Maybe the later ones are better, but some of them are rather tedious (play 30 games), and you can only pursue three at a time. Keep in mind that most of the shop items themselves- jump faster, attract screws from father away, increase your score multiplier- aren't anything exciting, in my opinion.  You can cancel a jump by holding down the left mouse button long enough, so there's no sense of commitment when you pick an angle. As the speed of the planets and fireballs increases, you can repeatedly cancel angles that look bad without any apparent penalty (unless I'm missing something). It makes me wonder what will kill patient, precise players first: the fireballs, or boredom?  Now, I bought this for $1, so you could argue I'm being awfully nitpicky at that price point, and I don't entirely disagree. Still, I think Beyond Gravity really lacks a sense of longevity. If more gameplay elements- planet types, obstacle types, powerups- were added, I'd consider changing my stance, but as of this writing I don't recommend it.",-1,0

359580,Uncanny Valley,"The uncanny valley is an uncomfortable place to inhabit.  First hypothesized in 1970 by roboticist, Masahiro Mori, and then later coined by author Jasia Reichardt, the uncanny valley refers to the unsettling feeling of viewing and interacting with something that looks and behaves in a way close, but not entirely, like that of a human. Generally, this is used in reference to the way technology is quickly reaching a point where it is becoming harder and harder to distinguish between the natural and the digital, with the likes of humanoid robots and photorealistic animation creating an uneasy dissonance between what appears real and what we know to be artificial.  Approaching Uncanny Valley the game, the term would at first glance seem curiously bestowed. The aesthetic hardly begins to grasp at the lifelike, blocky characters and simple textures in no way attempting to disguise their digital existence. Similarly, Uncanny Valley is blunt and transparent in its mechanical introduction, producing to the player all manner of tutorial slides before the game has so much as begun, outlining how very game-y a game this is. But this disparity isn’t the result of a clumsy and inexplicable application of a term, but rather the basis of an internal dichotomy from which Uncanny Valley begins to execute an unnervingly grounded horror story.  On its surface Uncanny Valley is little more than disturbing anomalies and robotic sociopathy, but fueling these gross but not entirely terrifying encounters are more ordinary and distressing fears. The impenetrable anonymity of corporate hierarchies; humanity’s simultaneous fascination and terror at technological revolution and the possibility of artificial life; the daily mundanity and perceived insignificance of the working class, upon which all manner of inhumane practices are allowed to continue unchecked because the lowest rung on the ladder is the most readily replaced.  Uncanny Valley is terrifying because it takes America’s most entrenched capitalistic fears and proves them real. Yes, corporations really are as insidious and profit driven as they appear and we can do nothing to stop them. Robots will eventually destroy us and yet we continue to construct our own extinction. And through this all, blue-collar workers will continue to have no power, but rather be beaten down and eliminated at the mere hint of incompliance. It takes a conspiracy theorist’s mindset perhaps to buy into any of these lines of thought ordinarily, but within Uncanny Valley’s haunting soundscape and grotesque visuals, these ideas seem to hang over you suspended only by your own disbelief which becomes harder to hold to and gauge as the lines between dreams, reality, and what is actually going on begin to blur.  But I need to stop myself, because while it is easy to take the themes Uncanny Valley plays with and run with them, a distinction needs to be made between the horror Uncanny Valley alludes to and the horror it actually succeeds at conveying. And to that effect Uncanny Valley fails rather dismally. It may have a brilliant foundation for which to craft a socio-economic, technologically tinged horror experience, but it leaves it all on the table, opting for shock value over a lasting, pervasive terror. There is a lot that could be construed as frightening here, but little that stays with you once the immediate disturbance wears off, often before a scene has even come to its conclusion.  Uncanny Valley struggles in pacing itself in any way conducive to the sort of horror it employs. The plodding tedium of your character’s nightly shifts could have been used to build tension and explore the ways in which the game seems to position the working class as the default victim of every crime, but there is so little holding these segments together that often I found myself wandering a deserted building entirely bored rather than distressed, until an obligatory jump scare brought me back to attention. This hands-off approach is understandable within the context of Uncanny Valley’s branching design, with the decisions you make quietly shaping how the narrative eventually unfolds, but the variables at play are so opaque that there is no way of actually knowing what actions effect what outcome until it has already happened.  Part of me loves that uncertainty and unpredictability, because it fits so nicely within Uncanny Valley’s theme of insecurity and helplessness in the face of industry and technological innovation, but Uncanny Valley never finds a way to balance its mechanical desires with those of its narrative. Either the story plays out linearly (or with enough present information for you to knowingly guide it) and loses the element of unpredictability needed to really sell the plot, or it keeps narrative forks hidden to the player and in turn causes the plot to feel uneven and shallow by keeping so much of the story locked away on paths the player may or may not ever see.  Which is a problem inherent to any game which requires multiple replays to see fully, but it is especially bad here because the unpleasant and inscrutable nature of the game left me with little enthusiasm to venture through it again. Uncanny Valley is upfront in telling you it needs to be replayed multiple times, but it never gives a reason to want to. So much of the game consists of tiresomely meandering through empty rooms, uselessly attempting to interact with objects which may or may not change how the narrative actually unfolds. I felt as lost during my first playthrough as I did having beaten the game, as incapable of understanding the underlying forces at work within Uncanny Valley’s plot as when I was first introduced to them, and the idea of spending another few hours trying to break out of that mold is actively off-putting rather than compelling.  Uncanny Valley wants to be a game you discover slowly, that eats away at you a little more with each new piece of information discovered until the whole thing is finally laid bare in grotesque completeness. But for as much as it might pester me to see it through again the mystery hidden under its tortuous mechanics never became intriguing enough to force me to make sense of how to find it. Uncanny Valley scratches at the surface of some of the most internalized and adaptable fears of modern society, but doesn’t go deep enough to leave me more than mildly perturbed by its gloomy theatrics.

303210,The Beginner's Guide,"**Potential Spoilers**  (Not a game. An interactive introspective look at a creative mind and it's desire for validation)   This is not a game. This is a maturation of the medium.   You should experience this alone with headphones. Fully vest your attention for an hour and a half and create your own memory of a once in a lifetime experience.   This is a somber experience. Start The Beginner's Guide rather than starting that art house movie you've been meaning to watch next time you have a quiet night alone. If you go into this with with that mindset, you will enjoy The Beginner's Guide more than any movie I can think of right now.   ** A note on the genre this game has been placed in. 'Walking Simulator,' is the term I have been seeing lately for games that I think fall into the same category as this game. With the Beginner's Guide being my first experience of this type, I have to say that I am looking forward to experiencing many many more games in this derogatorily named Walking Simulator genre. The moment I post this review I am booting up this developer's previous game that started as a mod of Half-Life 2 released in 2011.

I think 1C can definetley fix this problem. The second gripe I've had with this game is the country balancing. I dont think that Germany should have all these overpowered tanks and specials, the goliath should not just cost three MP with a one minute cooldown.

230840,Daylight,"Daylight is a first-person randomly generated survival-horror game. Or how I like to call it, 'Pseudo Pac-Man'.  Basically, this is the game; You got a story area where you're safe, and story things happen, then you get thrown into a randomly generated maze, where you have to find a key, and find the exit. And then rinse and repeat, over and over, until the game is done. They try and throw a few things in to make it more 'interesting', with random scares in mazes and 'puzzles' in the safe areas. But the scares are super weak for the most part, and the 'puzzles' are such riveting things such as, 'Push this glowing crate in front of this higher stack of glowing crates,' or, 'Find the switch to open up this secret door.' Riveting.  Now, I may have drawn attention to my Pac-Man example, let me explain... Since most of the horror is a maze, you sort of just waka-waka your way through these mazes, which get larger as the game goes on. You have a map that forms on the phone you always carry in-front of your face as you explore, and as you go there are 'consumable' story pages that you can pick-up (no worries, they freeze gameplay, yo~). And as you explore, there is a ghost that goes after you. And you look for flares, which act like Power Pellets. The ghost AI I noticed while playing will not kill you if you're not looking at it, though. Essentially the ghost approaches you, and when it gets too close and you look at it, you lose. Ghost can teleport around like Slender, and sometimes you'll turn around and it'll be right there and you die. Also, Glowsticks, which you use to make objects you can interact with highlightable.  It's all fun enough, but hardly scary to me. I was not scared once when playing the game, though was tensed-up during a few closer encounters. It doesn't help that the two main characters (the one who you play as and some guy talking to you on the phone) are very unlikable. You see a chair slightly move. 'Ohhhhhhhhh,' your character says all scared-like. A tile falls from the ceiling. 'Ohhhhhhhh.' You start to realize that the character's reacting to try and be 'in-touch' with the player, but it isn't working. She cries to herself that she's scared. She says lines like, 'What was that? Was there something behind me?,' when clearing there isn't. And says she hears noises when there's no audio at all and stupidly calls out at random if anyone's there, and just... Ugh... I haven't felt this dissonant from a horror protagonist in a long time.   And then there's Mr. Guy on the Radio, who was never explained who exactly he was, but you can take some guesses. He's a guy on a radio, who's official occupation seems to be saying cryptic ♥♥♥♥ that means absolutely nothing. He'll ring off every once in a while, mostly when you pick up stuff, and rant on like some living Fortune Cookie.  And the story is incredibly disappointing, the files are lackluster to decent, and the ending is all kinds of disappointing. I'd tell you the story, but honestly there's hardly any story to tell. I guessed the stories big plot twist literally in the first five minutes of the game. And the story hardly has any presence in the game anyways.  The randomly generated aspect doesn't feel too needed, as most of the rooms look similar for the most part, and can either make what you're objective is stupidly easy, or a lot harder than it needs to be. I think randomly generated mazes wasn't the best idea on the devs, the game is pretty linear so the random level layout often can make the levels themselves feel rather poor more often than not. Scares and all that I can understand being randomized, but in a game that's at heart a linear corridor horror game, the random feature literally in this case just shifts halls and rooms around.  But it's decent fun, and it looks fairly pretty. The music is nice. I'd say it's decent if it's cheap, but it's honestly a very mediocre game. It's not terrible or even bad I'd say, I'd just say it falls short.of its promise, and it almost all comes from poor choices. The mechanics are good, and there's groundwork here for a good horror game, but the execution just falls flat a lot of the time.  Buy if cheap and like horror games as it's not terrible, but not worth it full price either, and honestly rather average as a whole.And it feels like a lot of other games that have come out in the last few years.",-1,1

I actually found glitches but they are very very few and don't harm your gameplay. As a bonus, there's a DLC (bought separately) with a completely new puzzle named Alf's Escape that is a great addition to the game, offering a good challenge to veteran Oddworld players and to the new ones aswell. If you never played Oddworld, this game is an excellent start. If you already played Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee in the past, you're going to love to replay this in the New 'N' Tasty's engine. It is even more impressive to see that such a game of quality like this one is sold for a real bargain and with a real relationship of quality/price contrary to what the great majority of the game companies do. 100% recommended to every fan of platformers!",1,1

218620,PAYDAY 2,"- Updated 14/11/2015 (Read below) - Updated 22/06/2016 (Read below) I loved this game. Like, really enjoyed playing it. Despite only have two people on my friends list who enjoyed playing it as much as I did this game was still amazing and really fun.   Then Crimefest 2015 happened and a lot of promises were broken.  Microtransactions were placed in a game where they didn't belong.   Update 14/11/2015: I said I'd modify my review and here it is.  There has been no real changes made to the 'microtransaction' system implemented other than being able to obtain drill drops in-game to open the safes. I'm yet to recieve such a thing and from what I've seen the chances are stupidly low.  Another note, is that I purchased an item called 'The Completely Overkill Pack' a while ago which had 4 masks and a 'secret item' which was going to be 1 of 25 unique items revealled at a later date.  I have since opened the 'safe' that we recieved only to get a really bad looking shotgun weapon skin, and I got lucky. The special skins we got had various rarity and quality so anyone who spent $20/25 on this item might have been stuck with something worse than another person who paid the same amount of money.   It's a joke. I do not recommend this game because it's being developed by a company who consistantly breaks promises and then says they wish to be 'transparent' with its fans and 'listen to feedback' which I've yet to see any real indication of.   Go buy KF(2) or something else because this was the biggest dissapointment and waste of money for myself since pre-ordering Lost Planet 3.  Update 22/06/2016: So now the changes are happening. They have been slowly progressing over the past view months. Microtransactions aren't being removed but they are no longer being applied in future updates meaning all future safes can be opened for free. This is good, it would be nice to be able to open my old safes for free but I kinda get why they haven't changed that.  The game is still fun, but I only recommend getting this game if you can get it and all the DLC on sale. It's entirely possible for Overkill to screw up again and I don't think they'll revive from it unlike this occasion. Regarding the Completely Overkill Pack, they did make amends by releasing a lot of new 'Mega Masks' which for the most part do look cool. So that was nice to have. I mean, it's not giving us the highest type of weapon skin but I'll take it.  Over the past few months they have been fixing a lot of the mistakes they have made and now that they actually own Payday2 there's no excuse to ♥♥♥♥ up in the future.   So I recommend this game, because it's fun, because they've fixed their mistakes for the most part, but just be cautious with your money.",1,0

216150,MapleStory,"Maplestory, a game that in it's early days promoted hard earned levels, items, and achievements. This premise of challenging gameplay where you had to grind away many days to earn the most simple goals is what originally attracted me to the game. The feeling of being able to achieve what most wouldn't dare to do, kept me coming back for more. I literally feel like I could write a book on my many years of experience in this game. So I want to keep this review short, and write that book later.   From playing beta to now (2015) This game is always changing, and no matter how much hard effort you put into it, a year or so later it will be irrelevant. If you do decide to play this game, please do not spend so much on NX. It's a very hard temptation to ignore, but you will be less depressed in the end. I have spent way more in this game over the years, I literally could have bought a second vehicle, brand new. Not only just in money, but time. So my advice, play this with some friends, have a good time, and don't worry about having the most 'elite' items, because that only makes you fall into a money trap that you will regret in life later.",1,0

287290,Resident Evil Revelations 2,"At the time of this revie, I've only had about one hour into the game, and that was playing ' Raid ' Mode the whole time so this is to be taken as a ' At a glance ' Review.  What the mode is, you are tasked with certain objecteves to complete. Sometimes they have different modifiers to them, such as no respawning or you're timed, etc. Now, what I enjoy about this, ( Others don't and it's understandable ) How the levels are setfrom stages from other RE Games (Story wise). Having played the previous RE Games I had the advantage of knowing the layouts by heart, but, enough about the map.  When it comes to unlocking gear for your character, you find these golden boxes in the map, you open them, it's a shadow of a gun with a CD, you take these back to your home base area and decode them to see what kinds of weapons you get. My first run I got a SVD Sniper and a Magnum, it's neat to see what you'll get. I recommend playing this mode with a friend though as it can be kinda dull otherwise, but! I shall delve deeper into the mode to see what I can find and then try some of the campaign. After which I shall add on to this review!  EDIT!  After getting about two more hours into this game with a friend, the raid mode is undoubtably fun with a friend in co op. I mained as hunk using an AR, a Magnum, the Samurai Edge, and a Machine Pistol. While he mained as Claire with a sniper and a handgun. He stayed back while I cleaned up most of the mobs, him taking out the tougher targets and keeping things off my back. I highly recommend this mode for co op.  A known bug though. If you are playing this game by yourself with a controller, I'm not sure if it's just me but, every time I pause with a controller and not my keyboard, it forces the game into split screen mode, but, this is a comman bug from what I've seen and it may be patched in the future. So far with everything on raid mode, it's a good 8/10 in my book.  My next addition to this review shall be on campaign, so if you feel like you want to read that, stay tuned!  Edit #2!  Alright, while I haven't gotten deep into the campaign yet, I did decide to stream my progress, but, I found that this game is a CPU hog, I have never had this problem with any other game till now. As soon as I started streaming my CPU meter Skyrocketed and capped at 100, ending the stream. So be warned!",1,0

218820,Mercenary Kings,"If you like Metal Slug- this is WAY better. All the old school charm, but none of the crappy controls. You get to build your own custom guns, upgrade your merc, and they didn't phone in the level content. I'm looking forward to trying the multiplayer.  EDIT: Nevermind. This game is a chore. The gun thing is fine, but there is not as much customization as you might think. Most combinations just make crap guns. In order to use special ammo, you pretty much have to use parts wou may not want or that may take away aspects of the gun you like. I suppose this was done to keep people from making caustic longrang auto shotguns or something. The reload mechanic is alright. I still love the art and the gameplay is tight, but man the boss fights generally suck. Not the challenge or the pattern or the attacks! All that is fine! The problem is that they change locations. You pretty much get the first encounter to defeat them and if you don't smack them completely, in the first go, they flee to another part of the map, immediately spawn (if someone is there or not) and start going through their pattern. By the time you get to the location where they spawned, you get a few prescious seconds to attack them before they flee again. Now, you could leave the game running where they last spawned and eventually they will come back to that location, but that is boreing. So basically, it is a lame dynamic that greatly detracts from the game.  This is not just one boss- but one boss they use over an over again.  Also, the massive amount of levels are mostly repeats. I could have done with a more cogent/crafted set of story driven levels, one leading to the other, or an open world, or a big overworld map, but this constant revisiting of places I just wooped up on and finding them completely repopulated with bosses that flee and hostages and all that . . . jeez. This little war is being severely mismanaged. I understand that he is cloning soldiers and repopulating the levels, but come on! The same levels over and over again? Why not hit the cloning facility ASAP! Cut off supplies to the facility, sabotage the AA guns, drop some mercs in over the wall with that heli (or use a teleporter) and de-CLAW the general! You have time to think about these things as you are running through a level for the 16th time chasing a coward in a jet.   The fix? Make more of the repeat levels optional and make the bosses only spawn in their next location when a player actually shows up there. That should only require an if/then check to see if a merc is in the battle area! Again, the game could be a lot of fun, but it is a chore, and thus, not fun. The more I play it the more I am disapointed, but I'll eventually finish just becasue I like Paul Robertson's art style and the action is pretty good.   Niche fanbase.",1,0

241930,Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™,"Well, now i played Shadow of Mordor, took me about 20 hours for 70% completion  It's basically batman in Middle-Earth with the extended bonus that you don't just knockout your enemies (Orks, Uruks), you kill them.  All in all i had a good time playing it, allthough it's a bit repetitive, not as bad as with the AC series. For example, there are like 20 prisoner saving missions which are all the same.  Stealth feels quite good in the game, because it's plausible that the orcs just don't notice you and don't sound alarm after they found a dead orc.  Graphics are quite nice, played it on a i5-2500k (4.2 GHz) with an GTX 1070, so i had all cranked to ultra, 60 fps through the whole game. Would have been nice to cut down on the slowmotion sequences after the first our, because after that you really didn't need so every combat finisher in slow motion during a fight where you kill 50+ orcs  I give this like a 7,5 out of 10 imaginative stars",1,0

228300,Remember Me,"Beautiful game, I really liked the story, its characters, especially Nilin (The main character). And of course, i loved the incredible dystopian ambience in Paris.  I wish it was open world to explore the beautiful city, but it turned out to be linear, which is not all bad because it allows you to concentrate on the story without deviating in other variants.  The mechanics of combat can be frustrating at first, but after some time and practice, it turns out to be easy and intuitive with combos really easy to execute, and the possibility of causing damage with special powers.  The game is not very long, but does very well with its 8 chapters. This is another of those games that hopefully will have a sequel. It was a nice surprise and it is a very solid game. A job well done in this one.  Rating: 8.5/10",1,0

The real star of the show is the campaign.   As for the multiplayer side of things i can understand why some people have a problem with it however iv enjoyed it for many hours they have some pretty awesome customization and the game modes range from your standerd team deathmatch to soul harvest (which is basicly kill confirmed for all your cod players out there) apart from theres a bonus theres pick up and you can become a demon and ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up to be fair the demon player addition is extreamly OP if you know how to use it properly   as for replayabilty i could quite happily play the campaign again on other difficultys  .....BUT WAIT THERES MORE!

ENDLESS DEMONIC HEAD SMASHING WHIST PLAYING WITH YOUR BUDDYS!. i have high hopes there will be lots of eger map creaters out there pumping out some sweet maps for all of us to enjoy cause with doom snap map anythings possible it appears   Final word overall iv extreamly happy with what ID software and Bethesda have done to bring doom out of its decaying tomb and revied a classic pc gaming series cause looking back on it doom 3 is pretty ♥♥♥♥ compared to this.

215530,The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing,"Much better than the rating shows. Van Helsing is a ARPG that actually delivers better than Path of Exile or Diablo III. For the price, this is a must have. The gameplay is very good and similar to either PoE or DIII, but what sells this game is the dark atmosphere, playful banter between Van Helsing and Katarina, and a fun storyline. It is great when you have consistent voice acting throughout the game. Even little side quests result in conversations with characters that aren't too long, yet keep you engaged in the title. The skill system, while not as good as PoE, still allows you to customize your character to fit your style. The customization is not limited to Van Helsing and also allows you to compliment your skills with that of your companion (Katarina).   Overall, if you are a fan of ARPG games, this is a must have and probably the most enjoyable experience I've had since Diablo II in this genre.",1,0

The first game felt like Star Wars, it had everything, the story helped shape it BUT this goes another mile in writing. Playing as a Jedi serving the light side of the force has never given me so much selfish pleasure in doing something that is unselfish. Playing as a Dark Jedi (Sith if you would rather call yourself that) enforcing his will through the dark side of the force has never felt as disgusting and great before. I won't spoil the story but it is great, this game was never fully completed however due to the developer Obsidian getting rushed, they were clever however and put all deleted scenes and voiced lines in the game itself, and modders found it. I do hope you pick up the restored content mod because the game is slightly broken without it. Now. Play.",1,0
232430,Gone Home,"Gone Home is not really a game; it's an interactive narrative experience. That said, there's relatively little interactivity. It actually falls closer to a modern art installation. You can walk around the gloomy halls and half-used rooms and occasionally a bit of the narrative will be revealed via audiolog tied to some specific unique object, but you are not in command of the story. You do not choose paths or change outcomes, you do not broker relations or even view characters interacting with each other. The 'game' might as well not have any input at all. It is a ride at Universal Studios, minus the excitement.  The narrative is enjoyable, if cliche, and takes no risks; telling the same Sixteen Candles/Breakfast Club story of aspects of everyday life straight out of the 70s/80s. It is serviceable, and short. By god is it short. I was able to 'complete' the narrative in about 2 hours, despite being, what I considered, incredibly thorough. I hate to give it a review rather than a critique, but it is simply a narrative, and not a complex one at that, and so I don't know how else to assess it. It is roughly the average length of a standard Hollywood movie, but with less plot than most, and nearly all of it delivered through exposition.  This makes a $20 cost very hard to justify. I purchased it on sale for $17.50, and still feel quite underwhelmed. Movies cost ~$12, have the same length and level of interactivity (since choosing where to direct your attention on the screen is roughly equivalent to choosing which object in a scene to pick up), and deliver more and better stories. If it were a movie, it would be dull, overpriced, and mediocre. The fact that it's on PC hardly makes a difference, especially since I see no incentive to replay it or even have a friend play it unless it was to impress upon them how dreary of a reentrance interactive narratives have made into the market (despite it's predecessor, Dear Esther, setting the bar rather low).  The long and short of it is it's hardly worth your time, let alone your $20. Amongst a sea of worthy contenders which actually have gameplay, it looks all the worse.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"After playing this game over the past couple of years on and off, I decided to write a review. The premise of this game is great, two factions fighting eachother with numerous different game modes, different classes with their specific jobs, and even a new co-op mode for those who don't like playing player vs player. However, I don't recommend this game to anyone currently and to look for another one. The reasons are the game mechanics. It's not realistic at all and it breaks the immersion. For example, a vanguard would be fighting three different people, instead of taking a defensive position they'd just walk backwards and forwards swinging their Zweihander like they are blind infinitely. There's also the weird mechanic of looking directly at the ground while overheading to get a super fast overhead that is most of the time impossible to block. And there's the mechanic known as 'matrixing' where you would crouch down and look at the sky, manipulating your player model so that the other person can't hit you even though they are right in front of you. I really wanted to like this game but it isn't for me, maybe I'd come back to it just to finish the achievements or when they bring updates to the mechanics.",-1,0

To make the game work is actually really simple as I have been playing and enjoying the hell out of it for hours now. All you have to do is 1. search for your NVIDIA control panel 2. From where your 3d settings are at the left, you want to click manage 3d settings 3. you want to select the program to customise as your storm 4 game and finally 4. Change from your auto select/global default graphics processor to your High qualtiy NVIDIA processor. It sounds hard but just by entering the control panel you'll figure out what to do but anyways after that I still had to turn some settings down but my game works super fast with no crashes and amazing gameplay so I do recommend this game definietely and I hope people thumb this up so others can see how to fix this.",1,0
360940,The Mean Greens - Plastic Warfare,"Unfortunately, I only got to play this competitive multiplayer shooter alone, because I could not join any games. When using the in-game button to search for games, it said it was looking and timed out. When I tried using the Steam server browser outside the game, it only found about 50 people playing this game, and connecting to a game that wasn't full just make the screen go black and I had to close the game from Windows as it seemed to have frozen and would not load. That said, I haven't been particularly fond of competitive multiplayer shooters for more than a decade now, so even if I had played it, odds are I would've have enjoyed it.  I could simply end my review there, because odds are that nothing would cause me to recommend this game, but it would be doing a disservice to this game if I didn't point out what I did see and hear. The visual aesthetic of the game is graphically simple, but artistically quite nice, as you play as a tiny plastic soldier in real-world-sized areas. The folks who made the game really put a lot of little touches in the maps, like birthday cards with simple art and bad joke phrases, half-sunken ships in a bathtub, and varied playable soldier appearances of both male and female soldiers. One map had me bouncing on gelatin up onto a birthday cake, while another had me riding rubber duckies in a circle around a giant purple octopus with an evil expression and a giant crown on it, while another had me riding on a fast-moving toy train with Christmas cookies on it serving as capture points like a Battlefield flag/base, and each team starts on the front of back of the train, converging into a battle in the middle. All of this is while circling around a Christmas tree and presents in the middle of the room.  Oh, and I did say I was going to point out what I 'heard' as well. This game's music is superb. Christmas songs with a slightly sinister/intense edge to make it go along with a Chrismas-themed battle aboard a train, and a new Happy Birthday song with impressive and fun vocals and music? Loved it!  For a game I couldn't get to work and that I honestly figure I wouldn't like if I did get it to work, I really liked this game. I cannot recommend it, because not only does it not let me into multiplayer games, but I also only recommend based on games I enjoyed playing enough to want other people to get the game and play it, and even if I could have connected to others, I and anyone else with my taste in games would likely not enjoy this sort game.",-1,0

After hearing the dialogue and seeing the art style I was beyond sold. Obviously I was super excited to buy it and I was sure it would be everything I love in a point-and-click game.  The characters are delightful, the writing is just.. It's the highlight of the game, alongside the quirky and creative 2d graphics. The main story is as absurd as it should be, but the one thing I was missing were the puzzles. I don't mean actual minigames or jigsaw puzzles, but a bit of difficulty solving certain situations. Whenever a 'situation' presented itself I immediately knew what to do, and this seemed a bit disenheartening, considering the adulty nature of the jokes in the game. If it were made for kids, I wouldn't be bothered, but it was obviously made for a more mature audience.  One thing I really loathe is getting stuck in an adventure game, but ultimately finding the solution is what makes it all worth it. Devs, if you're reading this, maybe make episode 2 a bit more challenging? Yes? No? Maybe? I want to feel like I have godlike intelligence!",1,0

34330,Total War: SHOGUN 2,"Shogun 2 is a highlight of the series, with an excellent, cohesive use of the little details that define each Total War game. Simply put, it never feels as if an element is underdeveloped, or requires a gear shift. Fundamentals like unit balance and progression, seasonal effects, trade, diplomacy, and Agents each fit together as well or better than any other game in the series; the smallest things, such as fog of war, movement, safeguarding your backlines - stuff that just make a strategy game easy to jump into - are especially strong. Though later games have added great ideas, evolving the series from lite wargame to hybrid 4X, I don't miss them when I replay Shogun 2.   In short, if you're new to Total War or skipped this one, you cannot go wrong with picking it up. Highly recommended.",1,0

294860,Valkyria Chronicles™,"A lost gem of a game released in the early days PS3. Valkyria Chronicles is an excellent JRPG, with a different take on the genres usual gameplay mechanics. By having light elements of a third-person shooter, tactical gameplay elements of a JRPG and the squad management of XCOM, it’s a fresh and new experience to anyone who has or haven’t played the genre. The game is packed full of hours of gameplay from the story missions, to the skirmishes, challenges and side missions, you’re bound to have a blast. Also talking about its story; the game is set within an alternate medieval/WWII era 1930's. Europe is divided into 2 super powers: the “Federation” and the “Empire”, both vying for control over a resource known as Ragnite. Tensions rise and soon a Second World War (or Second Europan war in this case), erupts and a small neutral country called “Galia”, is caught in the middle. From there you play as Welkin; a young man who has been drafted into the state's militia who is tasked to form a ragtag team of anime G.I. Joes to fight off the invasion of the all mighty Empire. What’s not to like about that premise? Also I like to point out the games graphics which uses a watercolour render which gives the game the look of a beautiful water brushed painting, which in my opinion is “F***ing tasty”. I highly recommend this game for those who want something fresh and new, and those who are fans of JRPGS or those who are looking to get into the genre. Well what are you waiting for? Go buy it!!! Give them money so they can make a sequel that's not a PSP exclusive!",1,0

234710,Poker Night 2,"Poker Night 2 is a funny gambling simulator.  You have a desicion to choose between Texas and Omaha Hold Em.  This game also stars Brock Samson (The Venture Bros.), Claptrap (The Borderlands Series), Ash Williams (Evil Dead 1&amp;2 and Army Of Darkness) and Sam accompanied by his hyperkinetic and psychotic little rabbit friend Max (Sam &amp; Max Series).  This game holds a lot of replayability with Achievements and even bounty items which you can win to obtain Team Fortress 2 cosmetic items and even Borderlands 2 accessories. For you chance to win these bounty items, you must first complete bounty challenges that can range from going all-in and winning to just winning a tournament, but after you complete them you must win another tournament to obtain the item. The items that can obtained are The Orb, Claptrap's Video Game Award, Necronomicon Ex-Mortis and Sam's Banjo. Another things that add to the game's replayability are unlockable decks, table felts and chips. You unlock these with 'Inventory Tokens' which serves as the game's currency. You earn tokens by coming 4th, 3rd, 2nd or winning in a tournament. There's also a drink system where you can by any of the players a drink for 5 Inventory Tokens. The drinks enable the players to give away more tells that they're either bluffing or telling the truth, but overall I find it to be a waste of tokens. Returning from Poker Night 1 we have the funny and entertaining conversations between these media stars, where we can just be entertained or we can just learn more about these beloved characters. Overall this is a funny and entertaining game with a lot of personality. 10/10",1,0

No better stress reliever than finding the most creative way to slay hordes of zombies!! :)  Fx 8350 EVGA GTX 760 SC  At first I was getting really bad frame rate, from 16 FPS to 60 FPS depending on the area (really sucked and very annoying). Tried every 'Fix' from Nvidia control panel (locking the settings), updated all drivers, disabling film grain manually, then using the 'Dying Light Manager' utility (boosted FPS to 18-20 to 60). I was frusterbated!  Looked through the reviews... noticed a trend. alot of people (including me) that were having issues, most appeared to be running Win7. I had 8.1 (x64) laying around, bite the bullet and installed it... I am aware most benchmark tests between Win7 and 8.1, show that Win7 handles graphics better than 8.1, however 8.1 handles CPU and memory better than Win7....   After the OS upgrade. The game runs at an easy 40-50 FPS, smooth as a baby's a$$ on all parts of the map!

113020,Monaco,"Imagine if old GTA games, Chip's Challenge, and Oceans 11 all stumbled into a blender owned by a Lego man.  Boy what a mess that would be. Thankfully, Monaco is 'not' a mess, but rather, a stealth heist game in which you and up to three other thieves band together to plunder the money of a variety of facilities in and around Monte Carlo, everything ranging from Casinos to Hospitals to High Security Prisons, being represented.  The game's two virtues are its deceptive level of gameplay depth, and its humorous design aesthetic. It's the personality hidden behind the neon pixels that at first attracts one to this game--the perplexingly simple yet expressive character designs go along with the frantic piano ragtime and silly french NPC voices, to be extremely memorable. You'll laugh as your little colorful lego thief pees in a toilet, wiggles their hands to hack a PC hollywood style, or hugs a wall and takes deep, ragged breaths after being shot--to the accompaniment of bloodied footprints left in their step. And as your little Mr. Pink dies from that one guard who peaks just inside your hiding place to bop you with a wrench, they explode into a neon pink colored skeleton, and the music thuds to an abrupt halt--only for the music to pick up again where it left off, once your fellow criminals put your guts back in (to the sound of hilarious squishing noises).  As for the gameplay, it's definitely the part that keeps you playing Monaco, long after you're familiar with its pretty pixel face. On the one hand, you can be a sneaky, super subtle player who never gets caught, never trips a trap, never fires a shot. It can at first be a difficult process to do so, as you're forced to learn by trial and error (due to the game's sparse tutorial elements) how to remain undetected.  On the flip side, however, Monaco, unlike some of its compatriots in the sneak-em-up genre, never trips over the hurdle of forced stealth. You can shoot people down in a bloody Scarface-esque machinegun massacre, lure guards and civilians into side areas off patrol and give them a wrench over the head, 40's femme fatale style, or be a clever ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, cut the circuit breaker in a particularly well-guarded facility, and just 'camp' the power room subduing guards who come with chloroform, while your (debatably) coordinated teammates do the legwork.  In fact, if you're in a hurry, it can sometimes be better just to run aggressively past NPCs, dodging from cover to cover to avoid security agent machinegun fire, or to climb in a vent duct to escape angry attack dogs who are onto your scent, rather than trying to outstealth them. And as a result of this flexibility, at first, it seems like Monaco will be trivially easy to play and win.   But Monaco is a stern teacher, and it knows how to steadily ramp up the difficulty to keep you challenged through around thirty-some different, replayable missions. As you go, new classes and items are introduced to the formula, along with new map features like security-trigger handscans, computer viruses, alarm-triggering ATMs that must be busted open for cash, and more.   The game is incredibly flexible in its approach, and each class is nuanced enough to be distinct from its brethren. (The one class I am not personally fond of is the Pickpocket, which tends to encourage reckless, self-serving tactics over cooperation, at lower levels of play experience.) However, the classes are not so distinct that they cannot all perform basic functions like opening a safe, or hacking a PC--it's just that some classes do these things more efficiently than others. So there will rarely be a point where you play a mission 'exactly' the same as the last time you played it, as you tackle obstacles in a level best suited to whatever class you are playing at the time.  Lastly, there 'is' a story to the game, consisting mostly of text dialogue, but which is filled with humor and an actually relatively intriguing plot, fleshing out the personalities and origins of the thieves you play as. The thieves themselves have some pretty charming tics--the Hacker is constantly making references to PC error codes and computer shorthand terminology, the Gentleman is your 'World's Most Interesting Man', complete with his own little intrigue and espionage plot, the Cleaner is a stoic psychopath who rarely speaks beyond deep heavy breaths, and the Mole has a terse Serbian accent and a Freedom Spoon which he employs with a mixture of bravado and thuggish loyalty.  The game does suffer from a poor matchmaking system, which is a bit prone to lag and connectivity issues. Also, the menu options are a bit confusing, and there is one bug with using a controller that prevents mouse usage until your machine is restarted--so if you tend to use a controller for some games, like Gauntlet or Dark Souls, but prefer a mouse and keyboard for Monaco, you may run into complications where your mouse doesn't want to work to aim guns til you pull a soft reset on your OS.  All in all, I give Monaco a thumbs up. There are a lot of visual tweaks that could probably make finding your way in the maps a bit easier, the story could use some accompanying visuals (even if just still scenes), and the tutorial aspects of the game are sorely lacking even after a custom tutorial map was added--but the game just has so much complexity and charm, that it's hard not to pick it up from time to time, if you can get past those hiccups long enough to get into the meat of the game.  Grab it if you don't have it, and see if you can't wrangle some friends into the heist with you on headsets. At worst, it'll make for an amusing weekend of cartoon criminal hijinx.",1,1

The controls are a bit broken, they don't respond sometimes and this can be very difficult when you need to execute your enemies for example, pressing the E key multiple times don't help to much. The grafic on this version is very nice but it's still suffering from flickering and other glitches, the music is nice and the sound can be bugged sometimes. I still recommend this game if you can get it a little cheaper on a sale or something. I tested this game on Win 10 and is working very good, most of the crashes I had were from alt+tab.

2360,HeXen: Beyond Heretic,"After far too long, I have finally completed HeXen. It's the sequel to Heretic, but while Heretic was a fun DOOM reskin, HeXen gets away from DOOM's influence and becomes more of its own thing, with multiple player characters, hub-based level structure, more puzzles, and a far darker tone. These changes bring plenty of pros and cons, and certainly create a unique experience.  There are three characters to choose from at the start of the game: the Fighter, the Mage, and the Cleric. (They have actual names, but they're not worth remembering.) The Fighter is a melee character, the Mage is ranged, and the Cleric is a mix between the two. I played as the Fighter because I'd heard that he was the best, and it's fun to just run around punching hundreds and hundreds of monsters with wonderfully cathartic gore and sound effects. The punch is the starting weapon (there are four total per class), and it's strangely effective; I got by using it almost exclusively for about 60% of the game before the challenge ramped up enough to necesitate use of the other weapons. I may go back and play as the other characters at some point, though, because the game makes it clear that the playstyles differ enough to make repeats worthwhile.  Heretic's 4-episodes-of-9-linear-levels-each structure has been replaced with a hub system in HeXen, the first of its kind that I can find reference to. There are 5 hubs, each with various levels connected to it by portals. Once the player completes whatever puzzle the hub was based around, another portal opens and the player moves on to the next hub (this is a portal-heavy game). It's functional, and it does facilitate the increasingly elaborate puzzles the game is based around. There's not a whole lot to say about it beyond that.  Those puzzles are the main addition to HeXen from Heretic, and they're a mixed bag overall. They're mostly find-key/button-to-open-door-to-go-to-new-place-to-find-key/button affairs, but they usually work pretty well, and the game settles into a nice groove with them after a while. Occasionally, though, there's a puzzle that involves something completely unintuitive, ridiculously well-hidden, way too far away from where one would expect, or just plain stupid, and those bring the entire game to a screeching halt. I had to consult a walkthrough a few times, and while I probably could have figured the hard parts out without one (as my 90s PC gaming predecessors did), it would have taken far too long and been completely devoid of entertainment in that time. The first hub is by far the worst in this regard, and I'm sure that this has turned away many prospective players over the years. Most of the time, though, the puzzles are pretty inoffensive.  The tone of HeXen is also far darker than that of Heretic, although this is mostly reflected in the environment design. It's wonderfully grim, grimy, and foreboding, though, and I like it.  Of course, not everything has been changed from Heretic. The inventory system is still there, and the items have gotten even more ridiculous in scope and variety, including summonable allies, repulsion discs, speedy boots, and a thing that will turn you into a pig (although sadly no Tomes of Power). Besides the health-refilling Quartz Flasks, however, I only ended up ever using any of these items twice: once I used a Chaos Device to free myself when I glitched into a floor and got stuck, and during the final boss I drank a Krater of Might to refill all my mana so that I could use my ultimate weapon to kill him in just a few hits. Apart from those occasions, I never felt the need to use any items, so I guess the entire inventory system is kinda useless. I haven't tried the higher difficulties, though, so it might be more necessary there.  Also returning from Heretic is the idTech 1 engine, which has been further improved. You can look up and down now, and there are walls that can move horizontally. There's also a jump button. Unfortunately, the somewhat slippery movement is still there, making HeXen's platforming difficult at times. Additionally, the plot has continued on from Heretic, and the goal of this game is to kill the second of the Serpent Riders, Korax, who never rides a serpent anywhere in the game but does try to bother you from pictures on walls which don't resemble his likeness at all. Finally, HeXen shares Heretic's easy-to-understand levels, making sure that the player is never lost.  Overall, HeXen is a pretty damn good game. The puzzling is decent, the combat is basically fun and cathartic, the atmosphere, sound design, pixel art, and monster variety are all good, and I actually wouldn't mind playing it again, which is uncommon for these old games. Give it a shot.",1,0

There are a couple of slight niggles in a couple of the puzzles which give them extra unfair difficulty but if you persevere, you'll crack these too.  In short I would give the game an easy 9 out of 10 - 1 mark deducted for the niggles in a couple of puzzles that have been noted in the discussions forum.",1,0

323470,DRAGON BALL XENOVERSE,"Having played more of this game than of most other games I got recently I can say this without a doubt. The game is FUN.   For anyone who has, like me, always wanted to make a character to join the cast of the Dragonball Universe, this game is a dream come true and I sure hope they keep things coming for it.   Now for some details:  The Good: - Combat is fast-paced and fluid. There's lots of opportunities to adjust things to your playstyle, particularly when you make and level up your own character.  - The Story is hilarious. Getting to take part in the iconic Dragonball Saga's as your own character in a (for the Universe) believable way is excellent.  - Character creation and customization is already pretty good. Guessing there will be more cosmetics added down the road, too.  - Playing with friends is a lot of fun. Particularly over voice.   The Bad: - Online Multiplayer is...laggy and unreliable. I find that I am having trouble even logging into the multiplayer lobby these days. This may be launch issues, but it still is a bit annoying.  - PvP. People who pre-ordered and use one of the overpowered characters will wipe the floor with you. Happily, the Co-Op is more fun anyway.  - Local Multiplayer same issue with inequality in characters.   I don't know of any truly ugly things at the moment.   All in all, it's an excellent time-waster and I am having tons of fun leveling up my little Saiyan girl and looking forward to do it with a couple more characters down the line. If they keep the content coming, I have no trouble seeing myself playing this for a long time to come.   Recommended for: - People looking for a fun brawler with a bit of lighthearted story and co-op fighting.   Not recommended for: - Fighting game purists who value a balanced approach and PvP.",1,0

This game is for you. If you are a hardcore gamer looking for a challenge then maybe not for you but I suggest giving this game a shot. Its tons of fun. Graphics are great for this style of game. I'm play this game over and over just to get a feel on all the options if gives you. Awesome game hands down.   -With love from a proud Woodbanger family member,1,0

269690,RymdResa,"RymdResa touches on a lot of what I like in space exploration games, but in a smaller, roguelike-ish package.   http://youtu.be/eH44lcrpwZw   In short, I don't think RymdResa is going to be a game for everyone, but it's one that I've been enjoying a lot. At its basest level, it's just a game about collecting items, gaining experience, and not getting obliterated by space debris. Looking beyond that though you'll find a game that's fairly unique, relaxing, and overall a very different experience from your typical roguelike/lite game.   While death will end your current 'run' in RymdResa, almost everything carries over. Spacepoints (currency), experience, achievement progress, even items all carry over from play to play, ensuring that you're always progressing forward no matter how long your previous journey was.  The audio/visual is simply stellar. Done in an almost Gameboy-esque style, the art is in many ways beautiful and fitting for the atmosphere that the game presents, along with the ambient soundtrack.   While the writing sometimes tries a little too hard to be 'deep', I find that overall the obscure/cryptic style and synthesized narration do a great job of building on that same atmosphere. It's definitely not a game that's going to give you warm fuzzy feelings inside (at least from my time so far), but does an absolutely amazing job at presenting the feeling of the vast loneliness of space in an almost soothing way.  Overall, I really like it and would definitely recommend it, definitely a title that stands out in the indie scene today.",1,0
22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"The Wild West meets the Fallout Post Apocalyptic world and a great game is born.  Fallout: New Vegas is an open world RPG set in a Post Apocalyptic world. Where Fallout 3 was set in D.C. this game is set the Mojave desert around the ruins of old Las Vegas. The theme throughout this game is a western one, but many different factions are present, each with their own unique (and often hilarious) style. And of course there is a power stuggle between a pre-war industrialist, Caesers legion and the New California Republic is under way and you are about to be thrown into the middle of it. What will you do?  This game is filled with great characters, hilarious dialogue and so many entertaining quests that it would be hard to do them all in a single play through. The DLC adds many more hours of fun although it is quite varied in flavour and in value, but all of them are worth playing at least once. The exception might be Lonesome Road, which most people loved but I had some issues with, especially with one decision it forces you to take that I felt was not one any of my characters would ever have made. But Old World Blues may be my favourite DLC for any game ever. The first fifteen minutes had me crying with laughter.   When you add the fact that the modding communty is adding more of everything, this game could provide several hundred hours of play time and still have things to offer.

I enjoy playing japanese mahjong, so playing against cute girls and hearing cute girl voices only enhances it. Now I just really want to win more so I can unlock more girls. It's a little buggy and the translation is a little silly but nothing that really stops me from playing the game.

320300,Car Mechanic Simulator 2015,"This game DOES go on sale quite a bit, so definitely pick up while that's going on if you're thinking about getting it. For under $10, it's a decent buy. I definitely would not buy for $20 though.   At the same time that this game improves upon a lot of the downfalls of CMS 2014, it still lacks a way to stop the mind-numbing process involved in getting to the good content of the game. After playing for two hours, I'm still grinding through basic jobs in hopes of eventually getting to actually work on my own cars.  I'd say the music has improved but still is an extremely repetitive playlist. They can't be more than 20 minutes long, if not less. **UPDATE** One new song was added since I wrote this. Probably a 25 minute playlist now. You're better off muting the game music and playing your own.  If you haven't played CMS 2014, then it will be more likely that you enjoy this game since you won't notice how little it has really changed. It has definitely gotten better since then, but I think that maybe some more time developing should have been used.  Basically, I really think that this game still needs work; but it looks like the developers are really looking for support from the community to do so gradually. That's fine. While it definitely is a finished product, some aspects of it just look very cheap. Don't get me wrong, I think this is a very good game. Not to mention it's pretty much the only mechanic sim out there right now. It's just that I feel like it still falls short of being a great game. It's almost feels like I bought an early access game without the label on it.  I don't want to say this about the game because I know that the developers have worked very hard for this, but I really wouldn't be able to pass off pretending to fix virtual cars as a fun activity to anyone. You're really better off watching informational videos on YouTube on how to perform the tasks you'd be doing in the game and maybe practicing on a real car than playing this game. Although it may feel like it has some educational value, you don't really need more than basic car knowledge to get these jobs done. Let's be real.  I really don't agree with how little experience points you get from jobs that require you to diagnose several different systems and repair them. To even be able to access all of the new features of the game, you need to get a parking garage which costs 9000 XP. Over 20 jobs later, I'm only at 4000 XP. At least there's a bigger variety of problems to fix, unlike CMS 2014, but it's still just wayyyy too much. Why isn't the garage paid with money instead of experience anyway?  All this aside, the game gets good support and still has updates and DLC coming, so there's hope all of this gets fixed eventually.",-1,1

For sure, one ends up at the end of the game with a lot of unused objects, but that just adds up to the replayability of the game to see how we could have done things differently.

243120,NA,"this game was interesting. Nothing more nothing less. I would recommend this game if it wasn't 20 bucks. In the end this game was boring after a while. I like how they give us free rein over a giant area at the very biggining, but without any objective it becomes boring very quickly. Not to mention te fact that the fights are very poor. They rapidly desending into who has the most health, and do you have enough 'water skins' to heal you if you fail in the first category. once the enemy spots you it's like they throw some unseeable flare that alerts everybody in the near 5 mile raduis that they found some nice noms. It would't be that bad i mean you can run away. Oh wait sorry i was thinking of another game. No the flare onl goes away after you killed every enemy chasing you, and all the enemies you atrracted while trying desperatley to run away , and to reload your weapon with the speed of sombody who dosn't know how to work there fingers. So the battles are poor, and the lack of meaning gives the large maps no purpose. But it looks pretty, you know if you like black and white. That and your not afraid to burn out your eyes trying to fix the brightness. I could go on about other things, but anybody who has acually read this much knows my opinion by now. In short can't recommend find somthing else worth your money",-1,0

365800,AdvertCity,"Disappointed. I was one of the kickstarter backers.   Let me be clear. This is a grindy game without any tutorial and a terrible interface. Once you get past all of that and learn how to play it, it's still horrible. And for 20 dollars you might as well kick yourself in the balls and call it a day. You won't find much playability here. Within an hour you're going to have seen everything this game has to offer. Maybe you only have 1M resource when you could grind your way for no reason at all to 10M. Just not rewarding or interesting in any way. Lacks any real content other than what you see in the screen shots.   If you want to understand what playing this game is like there's been many free flash games developed that are similar. Basically you have 'abilities' that can be used on buildings. The better the abilities (earn you more money) the longer the cooldown they have. So you might start out with something you can spam every few seconds. And work you rway up to a suite of abilities that let you juggle things that have minute cooldowns or longer. That's the whole game. Jump around from building to building to set your abilities once they go off cooldown again. It's even less fun than it sounds, becuase there's a lot of randomness to it.   The only good thing about this game is probably the style of the art, if you enjoy the screen shots.  I wouldn't play this game if it was free. That's my honest review.  ** edit ** I was banned from the forum by a developer with no ban reason given for saying the game isn't worth the price tag to another user who asked. No rules broken as far as I can tell. Really terrible behavior from a developer I backed to see this built in the first place.",-1,0

337000,Deus Ex: Mankind Divided™,"If you liked Human Revolution you'll like Mankind Divided it has similiar game-play but its more fleshed out and has more Augments to play around with, my favorite new one being the Remote Hacking Augment because it makes stealh playthroughs easier. Also the level design has seen a step up too and there is a lot of different approaches to take for each mission. The game mostly takes place in Prague but its a really interesting hub to explore and gets more interesting to explore as the game progresses.  The main story is average at best and has a few interesting points to it but overall falls flat and ends rather abruptly. I assume Square Enix is saving some extra content for DLC or the game was released before it was completed, story-wise at least because the gameplay feels complete. Were the game really shines is in the side missions, which are some of the best I've experienced in an RPG since the Witcher 3. The side missions are usually multi-part and take place across the span of the main story, most of them have really good payoffs story-wise.  The Graphics are good and it runs really well on medium settings on my AMD Radeon R9 390X 8GB, I could probaly play the game on High settings just fine but I hold off on that due to my CPU's heat output. Also the music is as amazing as you expect, which makes sense since the music in Human Revolution was good too.   So Overall Mankind Divided is a good game that could have been close to perfect if the story was more fleshed out and there was more than one hub world to explore. If you liked Human Revolution and want to play more of that but with more interesting augments to play around with than give Mankind Divided a buy.",1,0

I don't recommend this game to purchase.  I started playing the prototype that released with the Double Fine prototype bundle, and I really, really enjoyed it. I was so thrilled when the game hit Steam, and couldn't wait to see where it went. Well, it did add features to the prototype game, which I was playing regularly, so in that sense I'm still enjoying it. However, the game is extremely unfinished and buggy. Asking $10 for it is a slap in the face to consumers; they should ask no more than $1 or so for an unfinished game, if that. Basically, I've played more completed games from Pyweek, and that's folks slapping together games in a week -_-   All that said, I do like playing this game; I enjoy the space sim aspect, and since I've never really gotten a successful, self-maintaining base running it's sort of a perpetual challenge.

This is a superb game, it may not have godzilla kicking the ♥♥♥♥ out of your city at certain times but for me that's a plus. It's surprisingly challenging and rewarding when you sort out an irritating traffic problem, noise polution, or even energy and water.  The only problems I had with it were the timescales. You set up ore extraction buildings in the areas where it's in abundance and it's gone within months. The buildings will remain but you will notice that the ore reserves go quickly. Secondly, I think they may have got the sizings wrong. On my attempt I'm currently at 20k pop and can build a dam. For me, with that example, it's a little wierd that such a small population would be able to even consider such a huge undertaking.  However, those are the only criticisms I have and they are, admittedly, very minor, when you consider the rest of the game. It's great fun and well worth getting. A little hint I picked up - don't expand too quickly and don't be afraid to tear things down and rebuild.  The score I'm giving Cities Skyline may go higher if I get round to the add-ons but I am loath to bothering with dlc so it may have to stay at a very good:  8/10  Well worth it.",1,0

242860,Verdun,"I had never even heard of Verdun until it was released this week but perhaps that's not surprising considering this game probably has a small fraction of the marketing budget of the fellow games of it's subject matter (World War). World War 1 hasn't been really covered too much in games, or at least to the extent that World War 2 has so Verdun's setting offers to me a refreshing take on the first person shooter.  The colours are muted and almost like a sepia, which preferably reflect the bleak trench warfare that WWI is known for, It perhaps feels like an Indie FPS and that's what it is, but it's realistic without losing that fun element. Despite having only two gamemodes, they both offer some what of a different experience.  This game conjured up memories of playing the original Medal of Honor and Call of Dutys and while comparisons will be perhaps inevitable, this game already has hit me in the nostalgic feels.

41400,Doom Rails,Doom Rails is a Car combat game which promises to speed up the gameplay and add a great twist to it. But is it a game you will want to race through ? In Doom Rails you can pick from a few diffrent racers and the stories pretty simple. You are trapped in a mad scientist lab and you have to race through 5 diffrent tracks to win youre freedom. The story is okay for this kinda game but the most important thing is the gameplay. So how is it ? It has to be one of the worst car combat games ever to be created. The Enviroments are pretty similar and are boring. Even though you can change the track in always feels the same so it gets stale quickly. The games you trying to complete goals which are timed while other racers try to kill you. The game cheats horribly. So let me explain. There are weapons that you need to kill enemies that are laid on the track. When you hit a buttont to get them you always miss them. When you pick them up is decided by dumb luck. Enemies constantly spawn on you so its hard to kill anyone or get an item. Overall Doom Rails is a pathetic excuse for a car combat game and not to mention it has DRM that states you can play the game only on 5 machines. Doom Rails is boring and a poorly done game if you want to pick it up wait for a huge discount. I give Doom Rails a 4/10,-1,1
269670,BADLAND: Game of the Year Edition,"Let me just say that I was one of the first to buy this game when it came out on Android, and it became my favorite mobile game. It still is! And when I saw it was ported onto Steam, I bought it ASAP. What do I think of the port? It's great. It can be a bit unnerving to be able to go backwards now, unlike the mobile version, but it is a very minor problem that I quickly adjusted to.  The art is fantastic, the atmosphere sometimes sunny, sometimes scary, but always mysterious. There is no soundtrack, but the ambience and sound effects greatly add to the tone.  This version has bonus worlds, which really expands the game from what it used to be.  And multiplayer has never been better. It was amazing on Android, the great race against your friends to see who can best survive the chaotic environment. Not only does this game have more unique multiplayer levels, it also has an added co-op too!  The power-ups are fun, I love becoming a mammoth beast that crushes everything, or a swarm of swift creatures that are difficult to kill in numbers.  The difficulty of levels increases nicely too, and I never find myself too frustrated to continue the game.  So do I reccomend this game? Of course! From its great visuals to entertaining gameplay, it is truly a gem. It may not be my favorite game on Steam (Papers, Please, but THAT'S another review), but BADLANDS is definitely an entertaining game to pick up.",1,0

I had hoped for more but at the very least even the story failed to impress and thus make this a jumbled piece of nonsense that quite frankly cant be considered a game.  Its an old story revamped to play out in the future where once again we see the cant be controlled monkey be corralled by a mystical headband which in the future is nothing more than certain death while the monk from the story of old is replaced with a woman called Trip. The pair agree a deal to work together to reunite Trip with her people which while forming part of most of the beginning levels is just a rue for yet another AI romance forged through hardship and toil.  As for the game aspect their is none, its all go their do this, do that and repeat, repeat, repeat. You get to collect orbs along the way for upgrade purposes but sadly they feel nothing more than a downgrading of skill level rather than a souping up of arsenal which isnt that diverse to begin with.

The worst part is I got this from a 3rd party souce so I am not even eligable for a refund.  If you plan on useing a wheel, you are screwed.  If you are ok with an xbox controller, then proceed at your own risk.  EDIT: Update Its messed up how what was suppose to be an exclusive car is not anymore. If I had known it wasn't truly exclusive I would not have got the game from an outside source. I had no intent on using the 'Fantasy Car' , but the perks of having exclusive content was my final determining factor.  If I had not bought the game from an outside source (Greenman) I could ask for a refund. So this car is the reason I am stuck with a broken game.  All I have wanted more than anything out of rally games is to have a true to life accurate recreation. This game is an embarrassment to the rally genre. Dirt Rally is leaps and bounds better than this.",-1,0

42210,Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill,"I played these games a lot growing up - Her Interactive was making the only 'girl' games that weren't about dress up or associated with rainbows or ponies in some way. I bought this game for the nostalgia really, and I wasn't disappointed. A lot has changed since the 2-D characters meet 3-D background style of the original Secrets Can Kill, but this game is riddled with tons of coded messages, easter eggs, and the like. I've grown out of the series, but it was nice for the little 'throwback.'  PROS: -Great (and very well executed) story. -Beautiful graphics, at least for the bakcgrounds.  CONS: -VERY short, I finished it in a go of about 4 or 5 hours I believe. -Sometimes it felt too simple - Not a whole lot of replay value.  All in all, I'd probably recommend this game only to young girls and those who grew up with or enjoyed the franchise.",1,0
394510,HELLDIVERS™,"Pretty fantastic game. First of all, the combat is just excellent. The gunplay is great and its safe to say it gets as close to the feeling of wielding an actual gun that an isometric game can get. Oh, and also the fact that you are a freedom fighter mowing down communist cyborgs, giant alien bugs (Only good bug is a dead bug, STARSHIP TROOPERS), and the high-tech protoss-like Illuminate all three of whom wish to snuff out the beautiful shining beacon of hope that is democracy. But worry not, you are a Helldiver and it is your job to spread managed democracy throughout the galaxy.  Alright now that I'm done with my freedom speal lets get on to some other great things about this game. &gt;Large variety of enviroments to perform missions in: Lush tropical planets, scorching hot volcanic planets, frigid snowy planets, and dry desert wasteland planets. &gt;Three races of despicable aliens to spread democracy to: Cyborgs, The Illuminate, and of course THE BUGS! &gt;Galactic Campaign: This is probaly my second favorite part of the game behind combat. The galactic campaign is the war that you fight along with the rest of the Helldivers community. Basically there are three fronts which you can fight on, one for each species. Everytime a player completes a mission on the war front, community influence is gained. Once the community collectively gains enough influence by completing missions, the system is captured and the front is advanced. After awhile, the front will advance to that alien races homeworld, where an attack event is triggered. If the community gains enough influence in 48 hours, the aliens homeworld will be taken and they will be out of the war. Once that has happened to all three aliens, the war is won and it resets to a new one. The opposite can also happen. If a front is abandoned for too long, soon it will be pushed to Super Earth, where a defend event will be triggered. If enough influence isnt gained, the war will be lost! This element gives missions meaning and makes the game lots more fun. &gt;Multiplayer is extremely fun! Friendly fire is on 24/7 and it can get pretty crazy.  However, there are a few flaws. &gt;The camera in multiplayer: For some reason the camera focuses around the center of the party for everyone. So if one person is stuck a significant distance from another person, everyones camera will 'stretch' to include them. This often leads to enemy scouts spotting you from off-screen in multiplayer. I don't understand why everyone can't have their own individual camera view focused on them. &gt;The DLC: Honestly, this isn't horrible, it's just that the DLC give you bonuses and it kinda makes it pay-to-win for a game you already payed for. Although, the bonuses aren't horribly much.  Overall, well worth $20. Maybe not worth the $40 which is the deluxe edition that comes with all the DLC. Great game that if handled well could become even better.",1,0

219680,Proteus,"It's pretty clear within a few minutes of playing that there isn't much to do in Proteus, and yet I keep returning to it. Essentially you wander around a procedurally generated island, one that's full of life, colour and sound. It's a captivating sight, and you float around in a detached manner drinking it all in. You'll slowly discover that each creature, each plant has its own unique behaviour and sound, and it's quite rewarding finding some of the rarer critters and watching how their behavior changes from day to night. Eventually you'll discover that the island can change in other ways, and this is perhaps the only time that the game takes on board any kind of objective. It's enough to keep bringing you back to the strange world of Proteus, even though you might not be quite sure how and why you got there. A lot of people seem overly concerned with whether Proteus is a game. To be honest, if that kind of thing is likely to matter to you, then give this a miss. Otherwise, I'd recommend experiencing this strange place, maybe you'll find yourself sitting contentedly on an imaginary beach watching an alien sunset.",1,0

281990,Stellaris,Fun game.  - Some bugs in it. But those will adress later i`m sure of it.  - No need to cheat. Its simple and easy to manage.  - Learning the game take up to 1 hour at most rest is easy to do.  - Combat is simple and some tactics in fitting (you are a empire builder not a combat pilot) so do not buy it for that.  - up to 39 AI and some extra`s (spoilers)   - achivements only in ironman. And thats is how it needs to be in everygame. - Bonus stuff and easter eggs (give you some good laughs about it) - Mini campaigne in it (events you can follow or just ignore)  - Great map 1000 stars and you know in every star there are planets you can discover or settel down) - Game takes more then 20 hours to even get out of early stage at 1000 stars map.   - No borring waiting. Like civ or most RTS games. - Random decks (research are decks stage so every game is a little diffrend for you even if you play the same race) - plenty of options to costum your race or edit your ship in every way you want however colouring your ship is not in this version perhaps a DLC?  - Voice tut always fun to lissen even he change some text depend on your empire picking - Lovely graphics just simple clean and how it needs to be.   (Do not pre-order any game unless you`re sure the game is worth to pay for)  A SIDE NOTE -------------- Do not make this game a real as possible because its all wrong. Do not compare this game with reality!   SPECIAL NOTE ---------------  Game bug (stuttering fix in 1 day) So ignore all reviews with that there are outdate.  Also people with less then 10 hours in this game and having a negative or possitive review ignore it. And people with 1000+ hours also mostly because of the fake / cheat program the have use to do that.  Also ignore IGN review there are COD fans we know it the know it.

264200,One Finger Death Punch,"Stick Fighting Simulator 2015   A simple, yet enjoyable game where you control a stickman to fight the bad stick guys. Controls are really easy, either you use your left and right mouse button or your left and right arrow key. The game doesn't offer difficulty levels, and will never be '2 EZ 4 U' since the game adapts on your skill, meaning it will always be the same challenge from the first time you played the game.  You can get different abilities scattered all over the map of the game that assists you through your journey. You can unlock more skill slots   up to 5 by beating all the game modes   to further assist you.  You have your survival game, where you fight countless numbers of enemies until you can. While on this mode, you will go through bonus stages where you beat stick figures and earn one health bar every 25 kills. Keep in mind that while you are in bonus stages, you will only have 4 hits so, be careful.  Overall, the game is really satisfying, and a great way to past time.  10/10 MUST HAVE",1,0

388880,Oxenfree,"Oxenfree is a new Indie Adventure by newly formed Night School Studio(2014). Who are actually made up of Telltale and Disney alumni! Now that is a quite a combo. Not to mention they are teamed up with Skybound as well!  Oxenfree features a group of kids who unwittingly open a rift during an overnight island party gone horribly wrong. You play as Alex, who has brought her new stepbrother along with you to the party. You determine the story through your dialog choices with Alex. The story and your relationships change based on every choice.  - Great art (Disney alum)  - Soundtrack is well done  - Interesting characters - Intriguing story/ mystery  - Fantastic world building - Awesome voice cast - Gameplay is fun  Gameplay is mostly exploration, dialogue choices and tuning your radio to pick up frequencies. Basic, but it has its own quirk so it's still fun. Lot's to interact with as well so it keeps you on your toes. The game handles conversation in a very unique way. Most of the time you'll be moving while talking and have limited time to respond.  Where this game shines, so far, is in its story, dialog and characters. Each character immediately has their own niche and personality. Some you will love; some you will hate. Oxenfree has a whimsical feel, but soon takes a mysterious turn. It does a great job of building up the tension early on between both the characters and the world. It's certainly hooked me, and I think it will hook you too.  Ultimately, if you enjoy a narrative driven adventure full of mystery and scares, I think you will enjoy this game. IGN reported it clocks in at 3-6 hours, however I'm being told it's more like 7-9 hours. Either way fair amount of time for $20, to me.   If you're looking for gameplay before you buy, why not check out my playthrough!    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cyjuO--KUs   I wanted this review to reflect my first thoughts. I will update half way through and when I've competed the game.   Highly Recommended.",1,0

113400,APB Reloaded,"GTA Online, basically.  Get this game. Mostly due to the fact that it's free to play, but also because its a solid game. It has a lot in common with the extremely popular GTA franchise, with its massive open-world, car stealing, citizen killing and varied weapon selection, but it obviously lacks a coherent story, since it's mostly a Massively Multiplayer Online game, so if you're looking for story, don't try this game. If you're looking for quick fun, action packed gameplay, try it out.   The customization is INSANE in this, you'll probably spend a few hours just to create your character. And the customization doesnt stop here: weapons, clothing (you can customize the clothings, not just what your character is weraing, meaning you can not only change colors but apply designs, logos, emblems, etc on them) and the many vehicles are 100% customizable (and usually upgradable aswell)  Thanks to its random missions and its nice PVP mode, the replayability is extremely high in this game.

It is a story of heroism, horrors, and sacrifices and it is easily, EASILY in the top 3 just plain stories in the media that I have ever seen.

In addition, the map is completely labyrinthine. I had no idea where I should be going, the map was useless, and I pretty much immediately got lost.  The star of this game is the aesthetic. It mostly sticks to the 16-bit style, and it does it well most of the time. The music is mostly ambient and a little creepy, which really hammers in the unease. As for the story, well, there's almost none to speak of.  Ultimately, though, I found I couldn't forgive the game's serious gameplay flaws.

After overcoming his crack addiction, he finds himself in a coma in a hospital off the coast of New Zealand. He wakes up 9 years later but then immediately has a heart attack because he missed the superbowl. When he finally escapes the hospital (because he can't afford the bill), he meets Liquid Ocelot (his son) who takes him horseback riding in the Andes.   He then travels to Afghanistan to talk about peace between the sand and the rocks, but the rocks steal all the weapons from the Russians and take over all of Afghanistan, killing everyone who is related to sand.  He then goes to Africa because his long lost son, Zimbabwe, was killed in a tragic pokemon battle, but finds out that he's not really dead, he was just covered in oil and sent down the Mississippi river in Ireland.  He goes back to Africanistan and the sand reveals itself to be XOF (FOX backwards, clever wordplay, I needed some research to figure that one out) operatives who killed him on the 405 highway.

22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"While running on the pre-existing Oblivion engine, Bethesda has done an amazing job taking the themes and ideas behind the Fallout universe and running with them. This game is not only an amazing FPS/RPG saga, it also has a high degree of childhood pleasure with the extensive and rather deliciously gory combat system. While still a bit glitchy here and there, post-release fan mods have opened this game up like supercharged street car, and there is an almost unending amount of customization and replay because of it. If you are at all a fan of wide-open sandbox format, Mad Max style post-apocalypse and/or getting to blow people to chunky bits, play this game.

You're a ninja that can double jump, jump slash, and climb on walls. As the ninja you travel various areas to defeat the army of monsters invading the planet. You can only take one hit so some repetition of certain sections of the level will be had. Even more so when obtaining collectibles that will allow you to unlock some neat stuff.  Also, if you are colorblind(to red or more), or you want a different color than red, the game provides a colorblind mode so you can change the color.  Overall I've completed the plus and classic modes of this game and, even though I've done almost all of it, the game is fun and is replayable.

The hard difficulty has a 60 minutes timer to complete each of the 6 chapters, you can skip puzzles paying a penalty of 15 minutes and miss-clickings cost 1 minute each, so 60 minutes for a chapter sometimes is barely enough and this makes the game very challenging. Graphics aren't very good and this makes spotting objects frustrating, there are lots of HO scenes but only a few puzzles (mostly memory games). It's certainly not a game for everyone, but if you don't mind low graphics and old style adventures you may like it.",1,0

The bow was definitely my favorite part--second to the site seeing amongst the cliffs and gorgeous sun glows. Putting aside two big pet peeves, the overall game was well worth it. Took getting used to watching a legit cut-seen only to realize I'm supposed to be paying attention to little buttons flashing up on my screen. Sort of took from the enjoyment when I could not longer watch the cut seen because I was so frustrated at dying by missing the ques. And lets just face it: no human being could sustain as many falls, knocks, cuts, and bashes as Lara Croft. Like seriously. No one. Not even her. Then again, the game had to keep the pace.

219910,Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes,"I played this game before the first one cause I thought this was the first one when I bought it, though I could still understand everything. I really enjoyed playing the game, and it's probably my most favorite point and click game so far.  Things I liked: - It has a very cynical humor, which is the best humor. - It has a dark story covered with a happy drawing style, which is really my thing (childish design but an horror story). - The main character actually makes you like her. - There is a cool twist at the end. - The english talking voices were very clear and easy to understand (it isn't my native language).  Things I disliked: - English isn't my first language, and I usually need people to talk slow in order to understand them. However, the talking on this game was too slow even for someone like me, which means it must have been REALLY slow. - There are a lot of animations that you can't skip (unlike the talking lines that you can skip by clicking), and this is very annoying when you click on things more than once and you have to watch the whole slow story part all over again. - In order the get most of the achivements you just have to repeat the same action tons of times, which is not only boring, but also annoying due to the above thing about the animations ^. - The tutorials for the puzzles were very unclear and I had to guess the directions for most of them. - There were a few points in the game where I tried everything with no luck, and I had to google the next step, only to find out it was some hidden click that I could never figure out without to randomly click there.  Over all it was a great and fun game, and I ended up buying the first game after playing it, which means the bad sides were not too bad.",1,0
22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"This game is one of it's kind for a nuclear post-apocalyptic style game. In my opinion Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition is better than Fallout: New Vegas: Ultimate Edition and I tell you why. It's because Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition has a dlc named Broken Steel that breaks the ending of the game and allows to keep with the same character. Fallout: New Vegas has no dlc that does that.  I had to wait 2 and half years before I got to play Fallout 3 because I did not have a good videocard to start with. But once I got the videocard I needed and started playing it became one of my #1 favorite game of my lifetime, I am a hardcore pc gamer all thanks to Fallout 3.

239140,Dying Light,"NOT impressed, and I don't understand how this gets such enthusiastic reviews from others.  1) Jumping puzzles. You like 'em? More power to you. I don't.  2) 'Open world?' NOT! You can get to where you are supposed to go via multiple paths. But you ARE going to go to the point you are supposed to. Go here, flip a switch, go there, fix a power outage, go somewhere else, do x, y, and z. Then, try to return to a safe zone before night. Oh, wait, you ARE going to be forced to do night missions. Why? Well, because you are. Not tactically sensible? No matter. You ARE going to do it anyway. This game is not about goals. It's about QUESTS, and you are strongly tracked. There is NO open world feel here.  3) Co-op? Yeah, right. You can 'be' in the same instance as your friends. So what? It's irrelevant. And, worse, you ARE going to get from point A to point B (see 2 above), and if your friends (or you) lag behind the others even a bit, you know, to explore, loot, and do something, anything, besides just running and jumping to get from point A to point B, well, in that event the game duns you to hit B to 'catch up' to your friend(s). Thus, everybody WILL move at whatever pace is set by the least patient person in the group.  I could go on and on. Basically, the whole thing is formulaic and even stupid. When you tire of jumping from building to building, you'll see what I mean.  Oh, did I mention that you've gotta love to jump? Well, prepare to jump and jump and jump and jump and jump....",-1,0
26800,Braid,"Really great platform/puzzle game. The game mechanics are really well developed, with a nice progression of difficulty. Lots of nice moments where subtleties of the mechanics allow the player to solve some puzzle that seems impossible initially. The game is quite short, but is devoid of filler: once it is clear that the player understands the ins and outs of some mechanic, the game moves on, rather than beating the idea to death for the sake of making the game longer. Music and art are perfect.",1,0

359870,FINAL FANTASY X/X-2 HD Remaster,"I'll try to make this short and avoid using any childish puns.   FINAL FANTASY X   Final Fantasy X is a jRPG which tells the story of Tidus, a boy who enjoys Blitzball (basically Underwater Hand-ball) and has severe family issues. He's playing a blitzball game until he gets thrown several thousand years into the future by a giant whale thing. It's up to the player to help him figure out what's going on and how to go back home. The story isn't particularly original, but it can keep the player's interest until the end, and most characters are pretty cool  Combat is turn-based and lets you use all of your characters in battle, with only 3 appearing on screen at the same time that can be switched during each of your turns, leading to many tactical possibilities  The character growth system is very unique and involves a huge grid where your characters earn abilities and stat boosts by moving in it through the use of AP which can be acquired by killing enemies. Each character also has unique abilities called Overdrives, which can be obtained in many different ways, incentivating the player to explore the game in order to find new Overdrives and become stronger.  You can also take on several sidequests and minigames which can be fun timesinks (like Blitzball) or dreadful minigames designed by Satan himself (the lightning dodging and the butterfly catching)  FFX's graphics are nice, clean and smooth. The cutscenes still look enjoyable today (and some of them can be skipped now!) and watching Aeons wreck stuff is always amazing to look at.   FINAL FANTASY X MINUS 2   Final Fantasy X-2 is the ignorant sequel to FFX which tells the tale of Yuna, who has somehow lost all dignity after the end of FFX, and her two friends, Rikku and Shadow the Hedgehog---I mean Paine.   Together they do all sorts of weird jobs, dressed like K-Pop idols and striking poses at every possible occasion, The main quest-line barely gets mentioned during the entire game but it involves Yuna finding a sphere that looks like 'Him', which leads her to join a 'Sphere-Hunters' gang in order to gather clues that might help her finding 'Him' so that they can 'laugh it up' together again ...that's right, he's called 'Him' for the entirety of FFX-2.  As cringy and stupid the story may be, the game itself is actually pretty fun. It is more open-ended than FFX, as you get access to the airship immediately after starting the game and you can go wherever you want. There's tons of side-quests and a lot more mini-games to do this time around, and Blitzball also makes a return (though it is dumbed down from FFX's blitzball)  The combat is revamped into an 'active turns' based system, with emphasis on timing and cooldown management. Said combat is spiced up even further by the 'Dress-Sphere' system, which is like the Job System from some of the older games in the series, except you can also switch jobs on the fly during battle.  The HD Remaster has all extra content from the previously Japan-only 'International' release, like the Colosseum which lets you fight old and new faces in arena fights of increasing difficulty, or Creature Capturing which lets you capture every monster in the game and make them fight by your side.  When you're done playing FFX-2, you can still find a good challenge in 'The Last Mission', which completes the game's story and takes place in a randomly generated, 80-floor dungeon that you must beat with limited items and party setups.  Graphics took a step up from FFX, with tons of new flashy effects and updated characted models which look gorgeous in HD.   THE HD REMASTER   The HD remaster is really good, and it runs smoothly even on toasters.  It also comes with a lot of new goodies, including an extra novel which is supposedly the Sequel to FFX-2.  If you haven't bought the FFX/X-2 HD before, then the PC version is easily the best version to get, as it comes already patched from all the issues which plagued the console releases, and the ability to choose text language and new/old soundtrack (which is lacking from the console versions).  The PC version even comes with a few optional cheats if you want to use them for whatever reason, and it even has a button to skip encounters and another button to make the entire game run 2 times or even 4 times faster than normal, which makes much of the walking/battles a lot less TEDIOUS.  ...  ...damn it.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi96ucB7ZdI",1,0
235540,Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide,"Fantastic game that is highly dependant on sticking together and co-operating. Despite it's high similarity to Left 4 Dead, Vermintide brings refreshing new things to the table such as a setting that is more melee based than ranged and a loot system. The higher difficulties and extra objectives in the game can really make it a challenge for even the most seasoned of players. The gametime you will get out of this game is highly dependant on you as a player, as just like Left 4 Dead it has a limited amount of maps so after a while you will be doing re-runs of the maps. However with the new 'Quest' feature it will reward you for doing so. So far the DLC released for this game has been very statisfactory for the pricetag aswell, adding new weapons, maps and modes and i hope they will continue doing so in the future!  All in all i would highly recommend Vermintide especially for people who really liked Left 4 Dead and other very co-operation based games.",1,0

220240,Far Cry® 3,"I can imagine myself to visit Rook Island; great scenic views, stunning tropical location, plenty of fun activities and places to discover. But in Far Cry 3 there is more. There is also a violence challenge, because of crazy men like Vaas and Hoyt. While playing this game I did plenty of terrible things i wouldn't even imagine. They made me feel uncomfortable, been disgusting, but necessary. Therefore I'm allright with Jason Brody's (main character) choices as he turns from normal young adult into a killing monster.  I'm not really into FPS games, but after playing this one I changed my mind. It was my 1st Far Cry Series game, and I already bought FC 1, 2 and 4, and planning to get FC Primal because of that. It's not only a shooter, it has great story, stunning views, great open world. The story is so intense, you will definitely lose track of time.  I do not know how hard this game can be just running into the enemies, cos I'm almost at the end, and going through it stealthy way with bow, or guns with silencer. To be fair, the most enjoyable thing are takedowns :-) You have all types of them in here. Also apart from the main story, there are plenty of NPC's to give you side quests, plenty of lore things to collect, read, many towers to discover and evenly spreaded enemy camps to be conquered. That's an amazing thing to play.   Pros:  Huge and stunning open world, which has to be discovered Varied, unpredictable and exciting enemy encounters Character progression and upgrade and crafting system Storyline, twists, side-quests   Cons:  Co-op mission desing   pejoluck's rating:  9.3 / 10",1,0

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"I like the core game; Rocksteady's game design, artists, sound engineers, etc were awesome. Exception of the Harley Quinn DLC that was hyped up to be more than what it ended up being as well as non-expressive animations on characters that are known for being emotive ie: watch Harley when she talks to somoene on the comm in the DLC; well aware that characters are reskins of Batman for the most part but deadpan face + awesome emotive voice acting == weird disconnect.   That being said, the immense disappointment that everyone feels regarding the PC port is justified. While I'm not going to bother with a refund since I'll probably buy it again at some point, it's nigh-impossible to recommend this game on a PC. A good game to compare it to is the Witcher, which also had its launch problems. However, the Witcher's bugs were addressed within days and with full communication from the developers whereas there was silence or worse, patronizing messages that amounted to telling us nothing new.   Then there's the DRM wrapper that is denied to be used but every game suspected of using it has the same issue: fps stutter on texture loading, which is plentiful in Batman: AK. Witcher 3 doesn't have any DRM (except the steam version) and it sold quite well. DRM protection seems to do nothing but harm the paying customers yet some companies insist on using it.  Then there's the company that ported the game to PC called Iron Galaxy Studios. A small team with no prior history of successful PC ports (keyword: successful). One of the worst issues are the texture loading, DirectX version issues, and most importantly, the memory leaks. When you're playing this game with settings turned down to a certain degree to make it barely playable, it will slowly and surely decrease in performance. Then there's the fact that the game stays in memory AFTER it's been closed. Maybe Warner Bros should have shelled out some more money to get a company that charges more, but knows what they were doing. Hopefully, they learn their lesson from this (as well as the gaming industry at large). On that note, Witcher 3 was developed for the PC from the get-go despite the problems at launch.  Back to the gameplay, the batmobile has the grace and elegance of a gorilla wearing a tutu. They added way too many batmobile sections that were not really fun nor were they challenging. It felt very forced and wedged into areas, especially the riddler challenges. Didn't even understand why the riddler would care about the batmobile and racing but I guess you could always argue 'it's just a game', the best argument when you can't defend the poor usage of a storytelling device.  In the long term, this probably kills any trust PC gamers have for WB and Rocksteady (despite my praise, not completely innocent).",-1,0
332200,Axiom Verge,"Axiom Verge is a 2D, retro-styled metroidvania game, with a heavy emphasis on the Metroid part. Like most metroidvania games, you explore a large and connected world doing things like platforming, shooting enemies, getting powerups, and getting new abilities that will help you solve puzzles, beat bosses, and generally progress in the game. There are also a good amount of secrets and some interesting story bits thrown in. The overall story is confusing and mysterious, which helps add to the alienated vibe of the game as well as making the plot more interesting. Without spoiling anything, the basic plot is that you play as Trace, a brilliant scientist that gets caught in a lab explosion, loses consciousness, and winds up in an unknown place. It's up to you to figure where you are, what happened, and how to get home.   As mentioned, the gameplay is mainly platforming, shooting, exploring, and some mild puzzle solving. You can find a good variety of items if you look hard enough. You can get powerups to increase the damage, size, and range of your weapons, as well as expansions to your health. There are some passive powerups mixed in with tools that will give you new abilities, helping you progress through the game. There are some interesting notes you can find scattered throughout the world that will give you more bits and pieces to the mysterious story as well. However, the coolest part is that you can find a lot of cool weapons. A few are required to get through the game, but many of them are found by exploring. These weapons all have their own unique qualities. It's nice because they are well balanced and do not require extra ammo. They all have inifinite ammo, meaning you can play around with them all you like. So you can use certain weapons to effectively fight certain enemies, cycle through all your weapons to vary your gameplay, or just pick your weapon of choice and have a ball! It adds a layer of fun to the discovery of new weapons. Plus, the controls are tight and the control scheme is fairly comfortable.  The art is very colorful yet fitting to the world of unknown mystery and wonder. I also found myself really liking the soundtrack a lot. Sounds a bit John Carpenter-esque to me. It's crazy how Tom Happ has managed to do such a great job with the gameplay, the art, and the music basically all by himself. The package as a whole comes together beautifully. The dark, mysterious atmosphere and cool techno influences mixed with a bit of alien flair make for an engaging experience that sucks you into the game for hours.  As great as I think Axiom Verge is, there ARE some negative arguments to be had. It didn't run flawlessly on my computer, but my computer is a bit dated and worn out as well so I'm sure it was not a fault of the game... just thought I'd mention it slowed down in some of the larger, busier areas for me. Hardly worth complaining about. This game is clearly heavily inspired by the Metroid series, and while I love that... you could make the argument that it is borrowing from that inspiration a bit too heavily. I personally think it has enough differences and unique twists to make it work as an original game expanding on the genre, but I could understand some people not finding it distant enough from that source. It'd also be cool to have a bit more of a choice in some story elements, but ultimately it is a story that you have to follow and your character is Trace, not you, so I suppose it makes sense the way it is. My only real complaint with the game is that you get a dashing ability, but once you get it you cannot turn it off. This can be troublesome for precise movements because you dash by double tapping in a direction. So if you're trying to move forward and then stop to dodge something and move forward again too quickly... you'll dash instead of just moving. You can lock your position or turn all the way around on stopping to remedy it, but it is a touch adjustment and can still get you killed in some hectic situations while you move eradically. As far as replay value, it's probably not a game you'll start up again immediately after finishing it. There's hard mode, which seems to be about the same but harder, and speedrun mode for... well... speedrunning. So unless you want it to be more difficult, you want to speed through the game, or want to go hunting for achievements, then you probably will leave it alone after your playthrough. Though it DOES have good replay value in the sense that you'll definitely be coming back to it at some point to experience it all again, and the amount of playtime in your playthough is pretty good.  So there are a few bad points, but the good clearly outweighs the bad in this case. It's a decent length game with tons of things to find and a neat story. The music and art are very interesting as well. If you like Metroid, Super Metroid, or metroidvania games in general, then you'll definitely appreciate this game. Honestly, it's probably one of the best games I've played on Steam. So the question is... is it worth the price? And for this one, the answer is yes. 20 dollars for 15-20 hours of great gameplay is definitely worth your time and money. If you're on the fence about waiting for a sale or just getting it full price, get it. It's worth it and it's worth supporting with the purchase. I couldn't wait either and I certainly don't regret it one bit. Axiom Verge gets a 10 out of 10 for being one of the best metroidvania experiences I've ever had.",1,0

400,Portal,"This game is one of the milestones, one you should have tried at least. I would argue Portal is one of the best games of the 2000-2010 decade, and possibly the most innovative one.  The core gameplay is very carefully introduced, and very well exploited: the quote 'Now you're thinking with portals' is indeed a very accurate one. The dry humor and the way the story is delivered, through the setting, are also strong points of the game and reasons for its fame.",1,0
369400,NA,"This is by far the worst game I have come across recently. Not only is the music so bad I want to yank my eyeballs out and rub my ears off with them, but the graphics are so sickeningly cute I fear they would burn through my retinas even though my eyes were, as stated before, already clawed out of their sockets in a desperate and futile bid to keep my ears from melting. The ridiculous prices in the microtransaction store only serve to drive home the hopelessness of having a microtransaction store in a game you could not pay someone to play.  But I digress. Don't play this game. Seriously. Seriously. (Seriously?) Seriously!",-1,0

There isn't much value in the game itself though so make sure to buy it when it is on sale. The biggest problem with this gamis that the narration is done so poorly, like the way fred.... well I can't actually give any examples since it would spoil the whole game but the story should have been told better.",1,0

65980,Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth,"A solid additon to the franchise that suffers from a lack of further support. The coming of Civ6 may have killed my hope for really getting something special out of this one.  If you're a fan of the Civ series, it's worth your time. While it looks like a Civ5 clone, the tech web and affinities are enough to hook you for awhile.   If you're expecting an 'Alpha Centauri'-level of lore, you'll be disappointed.",1,0
252490,Rust,Early Access Review,1,0
234140,Mad Max,"Mad Max, the game based on the the movie franchise with the same name.  The game takes place after some sort of apochalypse, so all the oceans have dried up (Don't ask me how, but that's just how it is) and you are just driving around in the desert looking for fuel to your car, the Interceptor. As you are out to refuel your car a huge bodybuilder with a rhino horn pen*s and a chainsaw staff called  ''Scabrous Scrotus''  appeared with his big @$$ car the  ''Land Mover''  and stole the Interceptor. You jump onto the Land Mover just as it drives away and try to get it back, stabs Scrotus with his own chainsaw staff in the head, get thrown off the Land Mover, and then you have nothing to do but to walk, then all of a sudden you find someone called  ''Chumbucket''  that promise you to make a car for you, he calls that car the  ''Magnum Opus'' . And as the game goes along, you keep upgrading the Magnum Opus until it become a fortress on wheels. The game is focused a lot on car combat, you can ram, grind burn, shoot and pull your enemies in it, and the game has got great ground combat too, it's practically the exact same as in the Batman: Arkham franchise.   More game developers need to learn how to optimize their games properly, in this game we have seen EXACTLY how good well-optimized games can run and still look beautiful. In my rig I have a GTX 660 (For those who don't know what it is, a 3 year old mid-range video card, which isn't that great) and i can still run this game smooth as butter (constant 60fps) on high graphic setting.  The game really looks great, while driving around in the wasteland you get the feeling of having dust in your mouth.  If you like Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor you will definitely LOVE this game. The gameplay is prectically the same but better in my opinion.  I give this game 10/10, because everytime I play it I have a great time, and that's what I think all games should be like.",1,0
214340,Deponia,"9/10 - One of the Best Point and Click Adventure Series!  I waited so long to play this game and I regret that! It's one of the best point and click adventures I've played in a while; so good that I'm sure I will complete the remaining 3 games in the series. The story is fun and entertaining and the puzzles, objectives, voiced actors and graphics really put this game at the top.  The story takes place on the world of Deponia; a futuristic world that has turned into a floating garbage dump. You are tasked with helping Rufus get the girl, save the world and get off that dump Deponia! Never EVER pay $20 for this game! If I didn't know any better I would have said it's worth the price... because it is! However, this game is on sale for 90% off literally 8 months out of the year. You can grab the whole bundle for about $4!  Although worth full price for sure! The bundle is on sale for 90% all the time!     Accidently Reviewed",1,0

So for my first venture into the series I decided to play Dark Souls instead of Demon Souls, this game is hard as hell but at the same time its fun as I like to see how far and long I can go before dying. I usually will last a few hours before being stuck on a boss say like the hydra, because well sometimes its hard to see where the edge is in that damn lake lol.  Over all I have had a good experience with the game and haven't had any issues with it unless i get disconnected from internet and takes me back to the main screen which i kinda dont like. Other then that I would rate this game about a 7.5/10 and this is based on me not beating the game yet, but good lore if you read through the items and challenging monsters and battles.",1,0
218230,PlanetSide 2,"The game sucks. I cant even register a stupid account to play the stupid game. On the other hand, can someone help me with the login? I entered in my Steam name as a 'station name' along with every thing else. And guess what? IT DID NOT WORK!! Im not trolling here guys, i had this happen to me probably over 10 times. This game needs to come out on consoles now, because im not wasting ANYMORE time with with the pc version. Sure you can tell me 1 reason why pc gaming is better, and i will agree. Though there ARE some games you cant play on pc like Little Big Planet for Playstation and Burnout for Xbox, Ps3 and PSP and the popular racing simulation series, Forza for only Xbox if you dont know what the first 2 games are, look them up. And finally, the game HUD looks like Halo as well based on gameplay i've seen on Youtube. If your going wast your time with the login and game, be my guest. Oh and one more thing, the game does look a little good but still, im not wasting my time with this either. I'm better off wit Blacklight and Section 8. They are pretty good games if you were to ask me. Thats all i'd have to say. P.S Im not a critic :p  Deleting",-1,0
356500,STAR WARS™ Galactic Battlegrounds Saga,The game won't work and I don't know why. Instead of playing the game it just becomes a video instead.

While the game is old, the graphics are good but also clean and neat. It doesn't get carried away with peripheral special effects nonsense that oversaturates so many other FPS's. Also, and most importantly, it is still supported by its producer Valve. It uses the anti-cheat software VAC, which has never given me an issue and which is also still supported.",1,0

Character, Bikes)  Can't build your own track (as far as I know)  When I said decent graphics, I meant passable graphics, not anything above the minimum for people not to complain  I personally say buy it, but when it is on sale, for example I got this game for $1, and not $10, I personally think that should be the price ($1).",1,0

Optional In game purchases: Similar to TF2, you can purchase cosmetics for your characters and ships, you never need to, however. You can unlock them by achivements.  Cons: Can be hard without a mic Without friends, it gets very boring Somewhat of a steep learning curve, there is a novice mode with the easier ships only, and, newbie players as well.

It's not without its frustrations, such as difficult to find switches that require you to pixel hunt and game crashing bugs if a coop partner disconnects/drops at the wrong time, but it's well worth the cost and those troubles.

92100,DETOUR,"Really good, funny idea; BUT! There's something missing, I don't know what it is sadly, DETOUR is the game best designed for multiplayers in my opinion. I haven't tried that feature out yet, as I am awfully competitive~ And I mainly play multipler as fps ;) But hey, that's just how I game.  The game takes place in a map that is parted into squares, it's your job to build a road and maintain a flow of trucks in order to win, your '$' is generated automaticly, and when a truck reaches the boundaries you'll win. It's funny enough single player, but there's a tool/ability that's way to powerful, the EMP. The EMP functions as an emp would do of course, but the time.. is actually so long, that if you time it right you can place some dynamite (on opponents tracks) and then emp the van at the correct time to make a double hit, that's something I wouldn't like to experience in multiplayer :)  Although this game deserves some credit, it's new it's funky, but for me, it was a one timer. The idea of 'reach the end first with x ammount of things' has been done before, not that it makes this game any lesser great or something like that, it's simply just not MY personal game that I normally would reach out for~  but alas, this game has potential to entertain friends and strangers for quite some time, give it a shot :)  7/10",1,0

252950,Rocket League,"I love Rocket League. It's easily my favorite game. Its qualities are endless, its formula is brilliant, its skill ceiling seemingly nonexistant and the skill floor in order to have fun very, very low.  Which is why I'm telling you to stay away. See, developer Psyonix recently decided to introduce a crate\key system modeled after CS:GO (a game that's a cesspool of twelve year old ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and russian cheaters in and of itself), a move that can only be described as making a quick buck off of underage gambling (this time on consoles too, just to lower that age range a little bit more and get us to FIFA territory! - just like that 12 year old kid who spent thousands of dollars on their dad's credit card to buy FIFA players...) To make a long story short, I want to be vocal and do not condone such behaviour, which is why I'm posting this review and hope to be one of many negative reviews once the crates come out. Please dump this terrible model, we don't need yet another game like this.  I need to update this for reasons.",-1,1

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"My personal experience with this game is awfully complicated.  The gameplay itself is astonishing, with the player being able to use a wide variety of options to tackle the objective provided. AIs are responsive and the overall game mechanics deserve some praises. Tag that along with stunning graphics and a compelling historical setting = Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain.  Although the game truly excels in some areas, there are sadly plenty of room for criticisms. 1. The characterization aspect of the game is poor 2. The 'open world' of the game lacks interesting areas and is uneventful 3. Although there are many gun customizations, options concerning Mother Base, staff memebers, and multiplayer settings are very limited 4. Too many loose ends and unexplained phenomenons 5. Overall, the game feels incomplete; especially with the 'repeat missions' in the closing chapter of the story   I feel that this game had the potential to become the best game ever in its genre. Unfortunately, because the gameplay is so impressive, the areas that lack stand out. Nonetheless Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a great dynamic game that might slightly dissapoint you, but is still worth the while and a serious contender for the best game of the year.",1,0

In all seriously though this is an amazing game great mechanics with a good mix of a luck and skill yes you can get ♥♥♥♥ed over because you didnt get enough fuel or missiles or scrap but if you are good enough you can find a way out.  The modding scene for this game is very lively and there are many great mods incase the vanilla game gets boring.,1,0
218620,PAYDAY 2,"its a Good game. but the support to 2017 makes me shiver alittle bit. They can not keep it alive so much. for me the game is not gonna be played for a while becuse its like i have seen it all and experienced it all.  Posetive + Fun game with friends + good amount of weapons and free maps + good amount of heisters you can play as.  Negatives - The amount of dlc Useless dlc like Ak/car weapon mod. the ai The cheaters can still bypass the cheater system, and doesent get punished The infamy system is only good to 5 rest is just maskes and more xp.  About the dlc Its real crap that the priceing is high but i can understand that even that you dont buy any of it you can still play the maps but someone else needs to own it.And hear your self saying pay-to win? that some pepole are saying how? its a co.op game if someone has a good gun you should be happy about it not wine about hes rich and such.  The crossovers  i feel are very yeah and a nah. i liked the hotline miami crossover. but speed runners nah the masks only makes us think about tv-shows and old games not speed runners. and in speed runners the payday charecters isent really even there you need to type it in. like its some kind of hidden gift.  The Problems that is still that some heists are still very underpaid in xp and cash like car shop and hoxton revenge. (yeah i know they are new but still.) and the flood of new players yeah its good with more players but please add a way of having a infamy only enter. with a sort of a limit like only infamy players or only level 5 infamy players. becuse as a player of the game i hate having to restart becuse mr level 90 guy that oh i have done this heist in dw i promise. ♥♥♥♥s it up like 1000 times.  so in summery its a good game with friends. and overkill where is the secret that we completly overkill dlc owners where promised?  2015-11-20 The problem is still is at a verge about the microstransactions. and im feeling a bit burned out. and im on the verge of never returning becuse i got pretty burned by the Completly overkill dlc. i feel like a sucker but i dident buy it att full price atleast. if they add some intressting stuff or value to the completly overkill dlc. il probley spend more time but now im not intrested of even playing more for now.  2016-05-12  as a winner of the first tournment editon i think they did a pretty decent job. The whole safe situation is not improved or changed in anyways.  i see in the weapon skins and some weapons that its inspired by some other games not counting working with other game studios.   Is dlc worth it or even worth buying?  get it in sale becuse payday is going in a way of release new guns and ♥♥♥♥ balanceing. or make all the guns usable or a valid option.  Is the game open for new players.  Not in a long shot unless you want to invest alot of time then i mean alot of time to get any good or do deathwish heists. unless you have a friend that has good knowlage of the game dont invest your time.   How to fix payday 2 Fix the game breaking problems like a thing that has being growing that closes down the game after a heist or open options.   Better payout after completing heists. the game is a bit grindtastic and the skill tree is gonna be free and by free i mean not paying cash for every skill you get.. that can be postive and negetive i see it both ways. but it opens more creative in builds and etc.   Why im changing my review to a negtive is becuse of these reasons. Older dlc is basically crap then i mean gun wise.  new players arent very welcomed in the community or by the game to be honest. and i know my time is gonna increase but that is more that i have invested alot of time in to the game and i still like it. and i cant give it a good rating becuse then im just being dishonest to my friends and viewers of this review.  they are working on it a couple of years still so lets hope they make the right adjustments for everyone. and not to theire wallets.  2016-07-08  The thoughts still stands about how they do everything. postive is that they made it easier for new players.  Problems is there is lack of a challange the new dlc makes it too easy. and the new dlc is just content that they already made but they mashed it together. tex biker dlc is just a shotgun stats  mixed up with the barreled with more ammo and diffrent stats. perk is a mix of grinder and anarchist. if it continues like this it gonna end with a weapon that is a mix of everything.  The way that they manage tournaments is a joke aswell.  Is it worth to get goty sure. is it a good game to stay untill they stop supporting it no. you just need to play a couple of maps then you basically have played every map.  Im not gonna support overkill anymore on the way they manage their games. unless payday 3 adress alot of issues. then im not probley gonna return to play payday 3. i really like this game. but so much potential squanderd and left in the dust to be completly honest.   This is problely the longest review that i have updated and this is the last update i will make to the review",-1,0

71250,Sonic Adventure DX,"This is a...retro game? No this game is cutting edge. Retro Sonic games are from my childhood like Sonic the hedgehog 1 and 2.   I turn around one day and what have I found? My favorite new Sonic video game has grown old. Its graphics are obsolete, outdated, what I so fondly recall as mind-blowing has been reduced to primative, crude countable polygons.   The music though, that takes me back more than any other aspect. As crisp as the very first day those stellar notes flooded out of my CRT and fueled the endless imagination of my young, impressionable mind. The voices, the movement, the environments, the characer interactions, all brand new, every second more amazing than the last.   Not content in having robbed us of the best character in his prime, the cast of VA's suffered a similar blow in the loss of the esteemed Deem Bristow; your talents will be missed but your contributions never forgotten.",1,0

209160,Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Game that made me think first: 'what are they doing?' This game is not finished and requires really good pc to even run without problems. CoD: ghosts focuses on intregrated attachments and AI controlled Bot killstreaks (dog, juggernaught and so on...) If you are going to buy any CoD game, do not buy this at full price. It's not worth it(i bought it half price and i haven't played it much compared to earlier ones). If you are going to buy any CoD game, I would recommend earlier cod's(black ops and modern warfare series.) Extinction is a nice extra add but i don't find it as entertaining as Black ops zombies. Multiplayer is not the greatest (actually the worst that i have ever played) but someone likes it, but i don't anymore. And there is no way to see your ping! Singleplayer is avarage, it would have been better but it's still playable.   Everything in one sentence: Do not buy it if you don't have good gaming pc or connection.  Extinction. 6/10 Multiplayer. 3/10 Singleplayer. 6/10 (*Updated*)",-1,0
397340,SimplePlanes,"I realy like this game, it also has great potential, there is a few things that would make it better (personally speaking), coloured beacon lights, possibly make it that unnatached parts that you forget to delete don't spawn in a just drop to the floor when you load the map especially when you start on a runway, also, I know that you have probably heard this alot of times and it's quite difficult to do but addidnt multiplayer with like a feature were you can have you friends join your game and help build your veihicles/crafts.

314120,Frayed Knights: The Skull of S'makh-Daon,Awesome turn-based fantasy game. I started playing since it was recommended as a modern version of Pools of Radiance. Similar gameplay. More humor. Great developer support. This is neither a hard-core min-max game or for fluffy carebears. You will die and everything won't be obvious right away. But you don't need the perfect class builds to be successful.  Most important: fun game at a great price.,1,0
381900,Bard's Gold,"I am a big fan of rogue-like games, simply for the challenge posed by them. Bard's Gold is no exception to that rule. When I first picked up my controller, I died nearly instantly. I felt silly, dying to a stupid bat, so I picked myself back up and went in again. I cannot tell you how many times I've died thus far, but I'm enjoying every obsenity-riddled moment of it. The slightly randomized feel to the levels helps you learn where secret treasures are, how to navigate through the obstacles, and ultimately, get your treasure so you can buy upgrades. I have found this much more enjoyable because there is a somewhat unpredictable nature to the levels themselves. The enemies are always the same, regardless of the layout, but each different scenario gives you a better idea of how to kill the monsters around you.  Guidance-wise, there isn't much, other than some one-line remarks by the Bard (at the beginning of some levels); you basically have to charge in and hope for the best. The learning curve itself felt steep for me, at the very beginning, but after I was able to progress through a few levels (after a multitude of deaths), I became comfortable and was not losing my precious power-ups immediately after I had gotten them. Having the extra life skillbook from the beginning is very helpful, but I quickly became stumped while trying to locate others. It was slightly frustrating not knowing how to find other skillbooks; however, the emphasis on finding secret treasures was enough to overcome that obstacle.  I cannot emphasize this enough: don't think you're done with the level simply because all of the enemies are dead and you have a key in-hand! If the timer isn't out, attack like crazy and try to find those secret treasures!   The platformer aspect of the game is enjoyable; it relates back to old-school platformers that I grew up with. I'm not sure if this is happening for everyone, but I have some moments when the double-jump seems to glitch a bit. It happens sporadically, and I'm playing on a relatively new controller. It is a little bothersome, but it's not enough to make me stop playing. That is really my only complaint so far, which says a lot about this game. It is a challenge and make you want to rip your hair out, but it is one of the more addictive games that Steam has to offer right now. Well worth it!",1,0

The game is obviously designed for the Casual mode, I started playing it in hardcore and by the the time I got through the first area I was ready to quit.

109500,Fowl Space,"I bought this game while it was in a sale. Not sure why... but I think the Steam Gods like to tempt me into buying things because, well, you know, it's cheap. It's actually pretty odd as games go. You're a space chicken trying to do something or other, who drinks coffee, combats space Vikings and collects hats.   Don't make the mistake of taking this game seriously. It's a parody of popular culture. With meme, film, music and game references this game is a nod to internet culture. The game did cause me one or two internal laughs. The whole point is to feel 'in on the joke' as it were.  Although I don't think it's fitting of its' £3.99 price tag. The controls de-sync sometimes, the game is nonsense to those who don't know what it’s referencing and it's rather unpolished. Controller support, better controls and support of different resolutions would add to the over-all quality of the game.  I did, however, enjoy the game despites its' flaws. There is some minor re-playability if you want to collect all of the hats and do all of the challenges.  4/10. Amusing but flawed. If you like internet culture, and fancy a giggle, pick it up in a sale. Don’t expect serious, or well-polished, game play. Enjoyable none the less.",1,0

305640,Shattered Planet,"Very nice rogue-like game where exploration is fun and rewarding above all else. Adorable art style and object references, Smooth and interactive gameplay and UI, solid mechanics and RPG element, it is a very enjoyable game.  Shattered Planet's biggest strength and weakness is its progression system. Between each run player can and should purchase permenant upgrades which increases the raw strength of the player. This provides consistent progression after each run which can be very exciting. However this also incentivise grinding to obtain more power in order to face tougher challenge instead of relying on luck and skill to overcome obstacles like a true rogue-like game. Since the upgrades do not change the way you play, the game can become stale quickly. Also the system imposes a cap on the game; you'll only play to purchase all upgrades and explore all of the contents. The result is you receive a more finite experience than other rogue-like games, which can be a good thing for some players.  All that said, I would still recommend this game to just about anyone.",1,1

241540,State of Decay,"Ok this is a tough one, There is so much positive about this game (concept, gameplay, conbat system, in-game stories yes stories) but frankly speaking its a buggy mess. There are bugs everywhere, after 12 hours of gameplay now the game engine has gone wild. Just an example , if i try to use a weapon my charactor starts punching zombies until i reload the game couple of times. That is not all, there are tons of other bugs.  My gameplay upto 10 hours was fun and i was sure i could easily spend hours and hours on this but then it just started throwing tons of bugs at me. I am hoping they will fix all these bugs in upcoming 'state of decay remastered' which is releasing 28 of April this year. Although this game is extremely fun (even just being a single player game) and it got heaps of stuff going on at the same time (Which is probobly one of the reason of its being buggy)  'NOTE: I am recommending this to those who dont mind buggy gameplay if the game is fun'' If you are not that person then dont play it.  If you ask if i will keep playing this game, the answer is YES, untill State of Decay remastered comes out. This is a lovely game, you should give it a try but there will be bugs all over the place.",1,0

261640,Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel,"Well to start off im definetly having fun with this game, I have put over 300 hours into the borderlands franchise. And its still holding up for me.   I have purchased most of the titles at discount prices and played multiple characters. And i cant seem to pick a superior title, maybe BL1 for nostalgia reasons.  But through all of the complaing that some people can muster up, the game is still funny, so many weapons, butt stoping is cool and the plot seemed well ok and tho lilith is a questionable character now (She is all i played in bl1) the next installment/DLC should be just as good. They also gave us claptrap and jack to play, like people asked for.  The story was short compaired to previous games but after 2 play throughs im nearly at 60 hours, thats better than any other coop adventure title these days over $60  So really every box is ticked, the games has its bugs, they can be hilarious/frustrating the jokes are probably to Aussie for some to understand. And the plot tie-ins for how some things happend on pandora because of what we did on elpis is great.  Cant give it a 10 but how about a 9 (Just make the primary campaign longer) Maybe they have some wicked DLC for us?",1,0
34330,Total War: SHOGUN 2,"I caught wind that my oldest and most loyal general was planning to defect, so I ordered him to commit honorable seppuku to preserve his honor. The fool left with half my army in the night, marching towards the lands of his new lord, the treacherous great lord hatakeyama. We ran them down like dogs, and slaughtered the cowards who deserved even less than that, but the general, and not one other man, survived the onslaught. One man with a horse? My armies couldn't catch him, so i sent my most talented assassin. At the ripe age of 63, he had single handedly shifted the tide of war in japan in my favor more times than I (aparently) had loyal men in my armies. But, he succeeded only in wounding that snake, and he slithered back to the hatakeyama capitol halfway accross the country. I would not be made a fool of. I burned cities, slaughtereed thousands, overthrew a 200 year old dynasty and declared myself ruler of the charred wasteland I left in my wake... And I never saw him again.  10/10 would feel betrayed again",1,1

Earning levels and new gear as a reward for learning is great. It triggers an urge to learn more and it's small sidequests about food, drinks and greetings are a fun bonus.

It's not horrible or broken, but it's simple, buggy, and poorly animated. The protagonist has a habit of walking off the game screen and having to be reset. The puzzles in the game are straightforward and with the hint system you'll never be stuck. The humor isn't quit as bad as other people say, I'll say I chuckled a couple times throughout the two hours it took me to beat it.

374320,DARK SOULS™ III,"Edited review.  So, basically, i fixed my game after realizing that i was one of '60 seconds crash' people. This can be fixed by manually increasing your virtual memory somewhere in windows settings. It was 3000-3000 (min-max), now i put it onto 2000-8000. And now the game finally works! FPS could be better though, but hey, i expected this... My PC barely scrambles the minimum specs requaired, after all.  The game itself? It's awesome! Those who liked original Dark Souls over Dark Souls 2 will be happy because Dark Souls 3 returns itself to the old formula using the same mechanics, animations and overall atmosphere. It also took some things from Bloodborne (off-series brother of Dark Souls) including dot-like lock-on.  Unfortunately, i never played original Dark Souls (though i watched a lot of videos of it), same for Bloodborne, so basically for me Dark Souls 3 is a whole new experience. And i love it!  Even more than Dark Souls 2.  If you have any issues with the game - try to google it. There are like 5-10 different types of crashes, bugs and other stuff that is most likely caused by something starting from low specs and ending with stuff like low virtual memory of screwd NVIDIA drivers. The game definetely worth a try to fix it,  I just hope we won't have another 'Scholar of The First Sin' accident.",1,0

55150,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Anniversary Edition","Short but sweet is the best sum up of this game. From the start, you're thrust into the bloody, violent combat the 41st millenium is famous for. This isnt a game to sit back and snipe baddies, or take pot shots as enemies run by. This game is for those that like to get stuck in and chop your way through the horde. The combat feels powerful, every impact feels like it hurts. Speed is not an asset, your fury and toughness will mean more to you than quick reflexes. Single player campaign could of been longer, or more in depth, but still, it's rewarding and enjoyable. Online play has some issues, but for anyone that's a fan of, or has even just heard of Warhammer 40,000, it'll still be a ball of fun that keeps on rolling. The class-based system lets you pick the play style that suits you best, though you will have to deal with some pretty heavy drawbacks of each class. Dont let the marines' lumbering steps fool you though, once battle is joined, it's fast and violent.",1,0

359320,Elite Dangerous,"Firstly I'd like to state something I haven't seen too many people write.   The game itself is really simple to get into, might take a bit to get used with the controls and how the mechanics like 'Jumps' between systems work, or how cruise mode works - and how the balance of speed and vector (Direction of entry) balance into things. It's a simple game, and with fairly simple mechanics - however, it has great depth despite this. Which to me is Elite: Dangerous's strongest suit.   I looked up a few things on the forums and some of the youtubers I follow (Scott Manley, Jingles.) But that was more after I learned of the basics on my own - overshooting my destinations, flying into stars, being blown up by Police and pirates. But the visuals always kept me in awe for the first few hours, and being given a free ship, albeit a really weak one, encourages you to make mistakes and learn from them as you go on.   The wonderful part about it however, comes in play once you've begun learning the ropes of flying around, exploring and how to begin your climb of power. It does its job of a sandbox well, and with the expansion of Horizons you can further the depths of the game, and merely landing upon a planet with your outfitted space-buggy can end up in an adventure on its own.   1. If you enjoy the deep complexities of the X series, this game /might!/ be something you'll come to enjoy a great deal, and I say might because as it stands, you won't have an army of NPCs serving you, instead that option becomes a part of the online experience.   2. If you are a fan of space sims and games in general, I'd highly recommend this game, I've put up about 30-40 hours of gameplay as of the writing moment, and I haven't had a single dull moment so far. I would stretch that it is a space game, and most of space is empty between spots. This is due to Elite's fairly realistic mechanics, and ontop of that you have an entire galaxy to explore, places where no one else have visited before you.   3. Don't be afraid to fail, it's the best way of learning a lesson, but be careful with what ships you fly, as they can get blown up, and if you're not in your starter ship, well, you might realize you can't afford the bill of insurance.   Lastly,   The sound design is amazing, the visuals are amazing, and it's a game I highly recommend for anyone into the Sci-Fi Space Game genre.   TL;DR : It's like the old Microsoft game 'Freelancer, but far, far superior as a game.",1,0

102500,Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™,"A tiny bit of it is unpolished but if you can see past that, you will find an amazingly fun and addictive game. It's like god of war mixed with a really fun RPG that allows you to pick your upgrades from 3 trees (Stealth, Fighter, Mage) and allows you to mix the trees up, the only limit is the number of points you have to spend and the level requirement for that tier, as well as the occassional pre-requisite to have an upgrade from an earlier tier to be in your repitoire before you can unlock a later tier upgrade in that tree. There is a main storyline, but the side quests are a blast and are littered throughout each map. You'll want to hit up the DLC content around level 9 or 10 due to the gear that drops being for level 1 through 18. The enemies are gorgeous to look at while you come up with awesome new combos or ways to kill them, and the view of your surroundings is beautiful in most levels. One of the most beautiful places to visit are the caverns with the all the glowing effects and magical sprites floating about, really nice to look at. Don't forget to check out the arena in the desert and battle your way to new gear and other rewards. So many things to do and see in this game, it will keep you enthralled for a good 50 hours at least. Add in a couple of playthroughs to explore each area fully and see the different reactions to another race choice and you have well over 100 hours of hard core RPG/action to fall in love with. Each enemy is crafted with such tiny details, my favorite is the one with the wood mask facade for a face that opens up to reveal some really sharp and evil looking teeth and glowing eyes atop a gaping mouth. So many details in the architecture make each area you visit a wonder to behold as you walk around just soaking in the view that the extremely talented artists rendered. I really wish there were more games like this. Just like with the Elder Scrolls and Fallout worlds, i could spend months in here and never feel bored.",1,0

If you can get a 4-pack, bring your friends.  Awesome game. Played it with my (now wife) when we were long distance. Thus the reason for the hours clocked up.

I love how the night brings in monsters to combat - but not so severe as you die on night one! I can feel myself getting better and better at crafting the right tools and arming my little guys ready for the onslaught (love the countdown to the hoard of nasties). Sometimes my little guys ddon't go the way I want and manual control is a bit tedious - but to be able to control my whole game just with a single point and click device means I can keep 3 limbs under a winter blanket and play whilst snuggled up.

I enjoy HOI4 for its faster pace, battle plans, multiplayer and greater freedom to fight the war that the player wants.

The key example of this is that you can actually prevent characters from dying (not naming any names to avoid spoilers for newcomers), which is great as I find you actually have time to learn about and get attatched to all of the characters you meet (both minor and major). The storytelling of the game coupled with the great voice acting creates a world that you can immerse yourself and spend hours upon hours in without even noticing, and the constant plot twists keep you on your toes. I could go on, but I'll save everyone some time by wrapping up my review here: If you're a fan of episodic games, Life is Strange is a must have.",1,1

Since it carries over choices made from Season one Clementine's development has become even more personal. Through out the first one as Lee you're shaping her moral view of the world, teaching her wrong from right in a zombie apocalypse (knowing those morals change). After Lee's death, you aren't just guiding this young girl anymore, you decide whether she follows the morals she grew up to acknowledge and respect. It's a huge amount of responsibility for the player to understand this and make the right decision (or what they think may be) in order for Clementine to survive but also maintain that innocence that destroyed by the zombie outbreak.  4.5/5 for the first episide",1,0

It's completely random at times, but the actual gameplay has stunning graphics and great background music. So far no bugs. The controls are fairly good, sometimes they can be tricky when you have to wasd-ctrl-leftclick-rightclick-space all at once, but that doesn't come up often enough to be annoying. Just enough to be challenging. Don't take it too seriously, get past the tutorials and into the fun. Should bear a motion-sickness and epilepsy warning though. Also, turn down the volume before you start, or you might get a nice headphone-blast in the beginning. Totally worth it. I have no regrets.",1,0
337930,Nameless ~The one thing you must recall~,"After learning of the existance of Cheritz a few months ago and playing Dandelion, Nameless' predecessor, I found out about this game, Nameless ~The one thing you must recall~, and I knew once I had the opportunity, I would definitely buy this game. And so I did, after Christmas, when I had the money, I bought Nameless , and since, I have been playing it when I have the opportunity. I'd only wished I had found this game sooner - I am a huge otome fan, and it was one of the best experiences I've had with an otome game, and one of the best investments of my money in a video game, by far. Thank you Cheritz, you have made one customer very happy.  Nameless is a very interesting story, which begins with Eri (the main character, name changeable) and her dolls, living a normal life, until her world turns upside down and she finds her dolls ALIVE, as  humans . From this an intricate story unfolds which changes depending on which character route you are on. The full story itself akin to a puzzle - you only know the entire story and the truth when you have collected all the pieces (or in this case, finished all the routes). Some routes are even locked or unreachable until others have been completed, which you will understand once you start said routes, and I was glad they were locked before I headed onto them. There are even two secret endings only reachable after completing all the character routes. Each route is quite long, approximately 4 or 5 hours per route. Be warned, Cheritz is a company which jokes around sometimes, but definitely does not sugar coat stories; there will be times the story will force you into tears or make you shiver in terror. Anyone who has played Dandelion knows this, but even Dandelion fans should note that this is an even darker story than Dandelion. And there are many ways this game can end badly, which vary from mildly saddening to  absolutely terrifying . You will experience a rainbow of emotions as you proceed through the game, and you will probably need to stock up on your tissues. I know I had to.  People who have played Dandelion will notice one thing definitely different in Nameless in terms of gameplay, that this is a choice based game instead of a stat-raising based game, which may or may not affect your personal opinion on the game. Your choices are critical to the story, one wrong choice could mean a bad ending. Choices vary from extremely easy to pick what's 'correct' to extremely subtle or misleading choices which will easily stray you onto a bad ending. There are also little minigames, such as the inevitable quiz, and a card matching game. The quiz was extremely interesting for me, and I found some of the questions easy and ridiculously funny (I had one question pop up asking if the people who work at Cheritz are aliens XD), while others were actual facts, or regarded how much you paid attention to the game. These little minigames, luckily, are not extremely difficult. You will never find them a huge hinderance unless you are just skimming through the game without paying attention.  Now, onto characters; the characters were one of my favourite factors of the game. Each one of them I developed a personal opinion to, depending on my experience with them, varying from absolute love to not wanting to approach them at all. Each of the datable characters is one of her dolls and has a distinct personality, with their own strengths and flaws. None of them are 'perfect'. They all have their own issues which are personal, and exclusive to their route. And as the boys change, Eri changes too, in some way or another. Eri herself was a very relatable character for me, she's a high school student, conforming to social pressure whilst having a secret hobby which goes against 'norms' which she fears to reveal to anyone. She's a very average teenage girl when it comes down to it, the only thing not normal is her friends and acquaintances, even prior to her dolls becoming humans. And doesn't everyone have something that they want to hide from the world as it is considered 'not normal'?  The side characters were also good, each had their own little quirks, and were all unique in their own little ways. My favourite thing was how each side character was characterised, specifically her friends. Her best friends were not exactly like her, and this is what I enjoyed. They both had their own personality different to her own but 'clicked' in well. It felt like a real friendship, they didn't always agree on everything BUT they were supportive of each other. My only little rant with this is that in certain routes these side characters are very unimportant, and sometimes just seem like they were used as filler.  The graphics deserve praise; as soon as I started the game and saw the title screen, I saw how beautiful this game is. The shading, the design, the colours are all stunning and mix together really well. Nothing in design appears 'out of place'. And the CGs in this game are  gorgeous .  As you stare at graphics, you may also notice one more thing; references! This game is a cache of references, to Dandelion, company mascots and popular culture. They range from subtle to explicit, both in script and in visuals. It's a nice and amusing touch to the game for myself, having played Dandelion and absolutely LOVING it before this one. It should also be noted that although it is set in the same universe as Dandelion, it is not a sequel to said game; both newcomers who have never touched an otome game and experts who have played Dandelion and many other otomes will be able to enjoy this game without hassle. (Even so, I recommend playing Dandelion prior to or after playing this one as it is just a really good game!)   The music is also amazing, from the opening song to the background music. The music was well composed and pleasant to listen to. The backgound music for areas always suits the environment around them, and each of the main characters has a 'theme song' which entirely suits them. I also have to give praise where it's due for the fact that the opening and ending songs for the main character routes are sung by the actual characters' voice actors, in amazing duets.   Speaking of voice actors, they are very well done. Each character has their own voice tailored personally to them which really does suit them. It is expressed well and the actors sound devoted to the story and the character. It is in Korean only though. If this upsets you, you do have the option to turn off voices for the characters in options, so it should not be a disastrous problem so much.  Even with a game as good as this one though, it is not flawless. As an English translation of a Korean game, this first issue is to be expected. There are typos and spelling errors in the game, you have no idea how many times I snickered when first was spelt as fist, or window sill window seal. These errors are, luckily, easy to ignore and only rarely break your sense of immersion in the game. There are also a few glitches and bugs, however, these are not game breaking, but they may mildly annoy you.   Overall, Nameless was a spectacular success that I can definitely recommend to any otome fan. The game really shows how much the company has improved after releasing Dandelion, and I am eagerly awaiting their next game, but for now, I shall continue playing this one! Within the last couple of days of playing I have completed all good and secret endings, and quite a few of the bad endings, too. It may seem to be expensive, but the price tag is   definitely   worth the game.",1,1

230230,Divinity: Original Sin (Classic),"Overall impression: A good classic style RPG with some new ideas to gameplay. Unfortunately alot of these ideas don't pan out.   Note: I played this game solo and in my opinion the game really is best played as a co-op.   Aesthetic: The graphics and music are nice even on the medium levels and it runs well. In terms of theme it is a classic kind of fantasy game set within an already established fictional world. So, yes expect dragons, orcs, undead, and all that to be present.  Gameplay: The game is tactical and turn based in terms of combat but in a unique action point based system. Also there are no movement grids but moving in combat does cost action points and leaves you open to attacks of opportunity. The games first fault is its unrelenting difficulty even on normal. Now while on hard this game boasts some of the smartest enemy AI I have ever seen, the AI also has a distinct predilection for cheating. Also the game does a very poor job of directing you where to go next. Now in an open world game this would be expected, but this is not an open world game. The games biggest faults are its diplomacy system and its puzzle elements. The puzzle elements are frustrating and completely unnecessary and often involve finding tiny buttons that blend in with the enviroment. The diplomacy system however is the worst offender. It uses a ridiculous rock-paper-scissor system that makes you feel like it is meaningless to put points into upgrading your diplomatic abilities since the computer cheats at it. Plus you can attempt to skip it by pressing an option button but makes it completely random whether you win or lose the argument. Now I know they put this in for the co-op to settle disputes between the players but in solo it is pointless and annoying and overall just bad game design.  Story: The game's strong point is its humor which is very self aware, tongue in cheek, and even breaks the fourth wall a number of times. Its a game that knows its telling a generic fantasy story. That being said the story is very good and has some very dark themes to it. It also becomes serious in tone at the appropriate moments.",1,0

304240,Resident Evil,Game runs very well for me i will list my specs below. I run at 60fps and 1920x 1080P with everything maxed out with a near solid 60fps bearing in mind i use an old GTX 580 1.5GB for this game the perfromance has been superb so far i did notice tiny slow motion in the save game rooms sometimes but it only lasted 1.5 seconds. I believe it was due to the lighting effects taxing my old graphics card as from what i hear this game has a much higher internal resolution then 1080P which is on be default you could change it in the TXT file to improve framerate but you could encounter crashes and a not so good looking game  Pros Great looking game rendered well Sounds Music sounds better higher quality i'm guesssing Capcom is using more modern sound system 60FPS is great to see as i remember the old game was 30FPS Higher resolution 1920 x 1080 is miles better then 480I New sound effects on the introduction video guns sound better new added Dog barks New 360 control system although i use the classic tank control but others like the new updated version. New costumes have been added to this version with the inclusion of BSAA Chris And Jill also rebecca i believe has an alternative costume.  Cons Sometimes you may encounter slow motion sequences when saving or exiting a item box for me it happened randomly and only lasted 1 to 2 seconds but it may be due to my graphics card but was annoying because when i was saving my game it took a good 15 seconds to finish when i exit the room the game was fine could be glitch or my hardware i'm uncertain this happened 4 times overall in one playthrough  Skipping doors it would be great to be able to skip the door animation as i do lots of speedrunning i love the classic design but a option would have been prefaired you spend a good 40% of this game stuck in door animation  Mods would be cool to be able to install mods to this game and make it better although this is unlikely  Conclusion  This is a great game that has clearly had a great deal of time and effort put into remastering it. It has been polished well and looks good for a 2015 game the sound and framerate sounds better and runs better so overal pleased with my purchase the only thing that would have been better is if there was more content to unlock and mod support  Overall  8.5 /10   Windows 10 Ultimate (64 Bit ) FX 8320 Overclocked to 4.0GHZ 8GB DDR3 2400MHZ 128GB Toshiba SSD 2000GB Hardrive GTX 580 1.5GB  Thanks  Joe,1,0

39510,Gothic II: Gold Edition,"What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said? I think I'm just going to repeat what others said, but I have to do this review  This game is incredible. As simple as that. I played it two years ago, a long time after it came out originally, and it still holds as one of the best RPGs in history. It has everything: A living and breathing world that changes depending on your actions, interesting NPCs, mission and objective diversity, a good story (not great, but it's interesting enough so you want to keep going) and a REALLY HIGH difficulty, which is what makes the game so rewarding.  I want to talk about the difficulty, which is one of the main features of the game. In fact, the combat is not the most difficult thing in the game; it is figuring out how to complete missions. This game is so realistic in that sense: You won't be given much information about most missions, you're left to reason and figure out how to solve things on your own. This might discourage some people from playing the game, but I think this is actually what most modern RPGs lack, a real challenge. For example, let's say you're given the mission of discovering a thieves' hideout. You won't see any markers on your map, don't bother to check. You won't have an NPC guide you to the hideout so you can just wipe them out. Nothing. You'll have to think and reason: 'Well, maybe I should talk to the people that have been robbed.' When they tell you they've seen someone suspicious around the harbor at night, you might want to go there at the right time and ask the right questions. And that's the best thing: for the most part, logic actually works in this game. This is, as I said, not a game for everyone, as it is a hardcore RPG, but it's definitely one you need to play if you're an RPG player.  The game is basically Gothic I with more stuff, more missions, more NPCs, more polish, a wider map, and a longer playtime. You can also download mods for the game, or even create your own. And Gothic I is already one of the best games out there, so...  Stop thinking and get this game. Trust me, if you want a more challenging experience with everything that makes an RPG great, buy this gem right now",1,0

211820,Starbound,"The atmosphere in this game is pretty well made. I liked the music and the art style. Every planet and biome is filled with its own life (And i would say sometimes its too much life because you really just can't walk around without stepping into something).  I did not really enjoy the battle system. Each creature in this game has its own style of attacking you. And that would be great if you had a way to defend yourself from most types of those attacks. But all you have got are shields, magic barriers, consumables which are used to improve resistance against certain type of damage, and healing items. The problem is that the amount of creatures that are attacking you and the types of their attacks are usually turning a fight with at least a little of strategy and planning into a mess. Instead of dodging or covering yourself from the attacks using shield, the easiest way to defeat any amount of creatures is just simply tanking them. Healing items don't have a real cooldown here (not considering the time their effects are active), so you can just craft a 100 of them and easily defeat any enemy by blindly rushing at it.  The bossfights here look beatiful but still are pretty boring because mostly its just attacking a standing or a slowly moving target and healing yourself from time to time. Guns like assault rifles and pistols are well balanced but mostly useless and not really fun to use. A fight with a gun here reminds me of fallout where instead of quickly killing your enemy usually you just have to hold the mouse and point the crosshair at him until he eventually dies from the whole mag of bullets shot in the head.  The main quest missions are not really much different from each other. Enemies in them were pretty easy to defeat (again they either had a lot of health or there were a lot of enemies with small amount of health) but dealt small amount of damage (just like your character) so the fights usually turned into slow rushing through the enemies) and i was not afraid for my life in any of these fights (this would be nice if that was just a storytelling game, but in my opinion its not, so the lack of challenge is pretty upsetting). The amount of side quests devs left for the final game is pretty small. There is a good amount of randomly generated quests given by people of your own town (or a village or whatever else you have built) but after completing more than 10 of these they get repetitive really fast.  I would say perhaps this game is not worth all of its money but it is a pretty good way to spend at least 24 hours of your time and i had many enjoyable adventures and moments in it.

17080,Tribes: Ascend,"Having played this a long time after the early 2012 hype, I can say that I see why people enjoyed this game - and why they left it. Of all the F2P games out there, the system in place here feels the most abrasive. So we essentially have a fast paced and highly competitive shooter (at least, on paper) with a unique concept, but we need to 'unlock' classes and weapons? I haven't played any of the other Tribes games, but even so I felt like I was playing a game that is a mere shell of its potential - and seeing how the developer outright abandoned it for a soulless MOBA cashgrab, I don't see it ever changing. The worst part about this game is that there are some genuinely fun and well designed parts when you get past the layers of cash shops and leveling systems, much like a puppy trapped in a sewer. It's heartbreaking, and its why I can't even recommend giving it a small trial.",-1,1

339230,ZOMBI,"I bought this on Steam release despite owning and never playing it on the WiiU... mostly just because I was shocked that they didn't try to charge more than $20 and because they confirmed a FOV slider. Of course I promptly left it on the pile just like I did with the original release until now. I definitely feel bad for doing that since the game is just as cool as it's fans say it is. The developers did a really smart job of borrowing some Souls game design and wrapping it into a slow-paced zombie survival horror game. While the run back to regain your weapons and supplies isn't quite as punishing as the Souls games, a death does feel more fittingly punishing than just a checkpoint restart. The level design is surprisingly clever and does a really nice job of feeling just layered enough to make revisits to areas interesting (being able to mark locked doors on the map is really handy). The combat feels just the right level of clunky. The melee weapons are pretty poor for mobs, while the guns feel slow and weak unless you nail headshots consistently. The balance works well and keeps each engagement interesting as you weigh your options. I loved the mood of the game too. It's aggressively British and the fog and grime help out the weaker aspects of the visuals.   Verdict: Give it a shot.",1,0

254700,Resident Evil 4,"After many years, I still enjoyed playing this gem of a game. The mechanics/controls may take some time to get used to them, but work well enough with decent keyboard controls. Still I would suggest using a gamepad. The graphical improvement is -aside from 60fps goodness - nothing special, but the game gets by just fine on it's interesting locations and design. Leon is a likeable protagonist and the story does a good job of keeping you interested, but it's nothing world-shaking. Unless you're a resident-evil-veteran(or if you played this game as much as I did) there's always a sense of dredd and mystery about what's around the next corner. The guns and weapons are all very memorable and fun to experiment with.  Positives: +solid mechanics +great leveldesign, fun bosses, interesting world that rewards exploration +Average playtime for a first try: 12-14 hours WITH added content like the mercenaries, Ada's assignment and other fun stuff to unlock   Negatives: -Why the hell do I still have to beat game on normal before I can play on professional? This really annoyed me in previous ports/versions and I really hoped it would be fixed in this iteration/remake -Keyboard/mouse-controls are managable, but controller-use is still recommended/necessary for the best experience(in my opinion) -HD remake without adding any content to the ps2/wii-version.

281610,Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak,"campaign was quite nice and enjoyable but lets face it with games these days its all about the multiplayer so how does that go? well if you like games like starcraft and you can build up ultra fast resources and pump out units like nobodies business then your gonna love this. if however your like me and find starcraft a bit too spammy and in all honesty just too damned fast then prepare to love literally EVERY game as your lovely little workers slowly toil away and they get utterly wrecked by what seems to be 10 thousand units, and if you manage to fend them off dont relax because ine xactly 5 seconds an even bigger army is coming your way. The matchmaking completly sucks because of region locking so you wait ages (ive seen the queue timer hit 30 minutes then i gave up) and when you finally get a game you get stomped because the person your matched against is simply FAR better than you and its not even close to a contest. The only way to have fun online is public games but of course this means no rank gained etc. I wouldnt mind this but i feel im at very least a silver player but being matched against players who should be diamond rank is just insane. So for the campaign yes i liked it, kinda worth the money but now its going to sit in my steam library unplayed because the multiplayer is so unbalanced its unreal",-1,0

I don't like a strict zoning concept of following a grid - this is not teaching me anything and less versatile.    I dont like how roads or ifrastructure works. I was expecting from game of AAA title to not have such issues with crossing infrastructures; half of my map is just empty infrastructure placeholders, while IRL they can mix together in various different ways (just staring out of window at high voltage electricity pylon next to my building).    Hovering and rotating map is another pain in ♥♥♥. A laser mouse should be added as a minimal requirement. I think no one was ever successful on the first try in stopping view right over desired area.

230230,Divinity: Original Sin (Classic),"I tried getting into this game 3 times now so I thought I'd write a review on my experience. I've never played the BG series that a lot of people seem to compare this game to so I might just not be a fan of this game style.  I could never bring myself to go pass the 2nd town in the 12.6 hours I've played. Most of the time I just ran around talking to npcs and completing quests/side quests that were pretty boring to me as some of them just involved running around town talking to people. Controlling 2 people in single player also breaks the immersion of roleplay. Arguing with myself (because we have 2 main characters for some reason in singleplayer) turned it into a what-I-wanted-for-characteristics grind using this system.  The combat and exploration is pretty much the same throughout the entire first zone. I don't see it hinting that the combat is gonna get more strategic or synergetic between characters outside of what I started with (aka tank and spank with CC's thrown in there that you start out with). The exploration involved opening a bunch of containers...many many containers and the occasional locked container hoping to find something worth wasting your time over because of RNG making the box empty or containing worthless items... and talking to a bunch of npcs for many hours...  Overall pretty bland and stale due to the pacing and the lack of sense of progression, and fighting being a minor and also very bland part of the game. The free exploration and being able to pick/steal anything seemed cool at first because it seemed to make the game have a lot of choices of what to do, but that is not true. Maybe if I can bring myself to continue playing this it'll get better, but as of pretty much completing the first town, I wouldn't recommend this game.  Main points of the game: - Picking items up or stealing them (gets pretty boring). - Opening a lot of containers in this game is a waste of time but is necessary (without mods) to have items to use/sell. - Talk to a bunch of npcs. - When you kill something, it doesnt come back (without mods). After you kill mobs in an area once, you basically cannot play with the combat system as there is nothing to fight.  - The respawning mobs in the mod also make originally friendly npcs not do anything while you kill them over and over and over for items and experience. They also respawn as generic npcs with no functionality other than dying from you breaking your weapon on them over and over. - Leveling is slow and very bland (damage and defense bonuses seem to be the strong point over getting new skills to improve strategy and synergy). - Seemingly random instant death events if you go to free explore. The only purpose of which is to make you restart the game at the last point you saved and anger you (mine fields, more mine fields, mine field in that grave you're digging, mob that's 7 levels higher than you in that grave that kills your guys in 1 hit, suicidal bomber skeleton in that grave you're digging).",-1,0

253150,Halfway,"First impressions of this game were; wow, a retroish 2d strategic scifi rpg. Very nice graphics, sounds and music! The game starts and for a while everything is great... but then the plot is getting boring, some seriously unbalanced battle elements are introduced, boring enemies, very stereotypical characters and the whole game is already well over the halfpoint. You can't predict what kind of stragey/team/equipment you need for each mission, and the whole play is mostly guess-and-fail; trying something little different and failing again... at the beginning the enemies are almost too easy and after some missions they are way too numerous. Using time to plan missions over and over again is not worth the empty plot. The first game that comes in comparison is Shadowrun Returns, which is actually the same game in principle but with different engine/story/characters/etc. Actually this game made me hope Shadowrun Returns would have been made with this game's engine, and with dragonfall story/characters/gameplay balance.

234670,NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 3 Full Burst,"So after playing this game and completing it I have made a few conclusions: If you're a Naruto Shippuden fan and follow the series, there is no point to having this game, unless you follow the games also.  if you are new to Naruto Shippuden this is a good series to start to get an idea of what has happened in the anime and manga series, (but if you are unfamiliar to the the original I would suggest looking that up before starting this series) although it doesn't have as much of the content that the anime and manga series contain.  The main purpose of this game is for you to know what is hapening in the series not for an original storyline or amazing gameplay, it's to tell you the story of Naruto Shippuden so expect a hell of a lot of cutscenes, enought that I admit drove me to the point where I stopped playing this for about a month from the bordome of sitting through all of them.  So onto what it does right and wrong, first I'll start with the pros: -It tells the story really well and does the franchise justice.  -This is one of the very few games that actually make QTE matter as you get rated on how quickly you complete the QTE with stars leading up to a maximum, if you get enough stars you wil get a secret factor which is a couple of shots from the anime and has a little bit of dialogue which is the same in the games 1 and 2 also,  -The music for the boss fights are amazing and the boss fights themselves are handled really well with the rating systems coming in to make it so much better.  -The scenes that want to make to envoke an emotion are outstanding.  -There are changes to the battle system occasionally, where instead of fighting one on one in a circle type arena, you play more like a hack n slash game where you run through different corridors and defeat a number of enemies, it's done alright but it can get annoying after a while.  So now onto the cons: -There are so many cutscenes, this game seems more like storybook than an actual game, they are also extremely long, wih most being around a good 2 or 3 minutes of just dialogue and nothing exciting happening in them, you'll find yourself skipping them towards the end just cause there was so many, like I did.  -The main battle system is nothing special, it's ripped from the second game this time adding a few more characters that feel different which is good, but it's just kind of bland with each character having a melee combo and one or two jutsu moves depending on how long you hold the attack button. Also some characters have spammable moves that are really cheap whch can get extremely annoying especially if you find someone plaing them online.  -The difficulty spike is awful, unlike ninja storm 2 where the opponents became more difficult over time, this one just has enemies towards the end spamming you with moves you can't dodge and just get overwhelmed with nothng to do about it, and throwing as many enemies as possible at you, either one at a time or all together, neither is fun.  -There is no free roam and most side quests are taken out, once again unlike ninja storm 2 there is no free roaming, the game tells you where to go and you can't do anything to stop it. The side quests have devolved to fetching items for one or two people where you can only get back to them once you complete the game, where you do get to free roam when you complete the game it's not as good due to the sour taste left in your memory having to fight through the main story's corridors.  -The lip synching is laughable, there is no attempt to match the character animation with the english version script. I know it's difficult but it looks like they made no effort with the characters lips still moving for a litle while even after their dialogue is finished (I would suggest to have it in japanese and put on english subtitles, the voice actors are much beter and it looks like the characters are actually talking).  All in all the game isn't bad, but it's nothing special, The story is great (apart from all of the cutscenes) but the combat is nothing out of this world, I would say that if you wanted a better naruto game go back to Ultimate Ninja Storm 2, it was much better done in basically every aspect.  I'm not going to give this game a rating cause that is usually just the person that is reviewing its thought, so I will just say if you enjoy Naruto and want to start Naruto Shippuden but don't feel like going through 350+ of episodes, this game sums it up pretty well.",-1,0

285440,Crimzon Clover  WORLD IGNITION,"I have a strange relationship with Shmups. They are games that I absolutely adore, where the focus is that primal arcade style of gameplay where the goal is to get good at it and nothing else. And I absolutely suck at them.  So, i'm not an expert on shmups, if that's what you are searching here. However, my review is intended for the people who don't usually play this kind of game and are somehow interested.  Not only is this a shmup, but it's a bullet hell shmup. Those words might send you imediate images of screens filled with colorful bullets that seem completely undodgeable, and you wouldn't be wrong thinking that. It's a very fast paced and frenetic game where your eyes are completely glued to the screen in awe of the spectacle happening in front of you, making impossible dodges and destroying all kinds of machinery shooting different patterns of bullets at you, complemented by a gorgeous pixel art and a bombastic soundtrack.  The great thing about the game is how it eases you into it, with a Novice mode, which really isnt as easy as the name might make it sound. The bullets are less intense, but you wont make it to the end without wasting a few continues on your first tries. There is also a great mechanic where you get to use a bullet erasing bomb that is available when you fill a meter, saving your ♥♥♥ alot of times.  Since you dont have to waste quarters to get continues, you have to set your own goals for yourself, otherwise you can just keep on dying and moving forward with unlimited continues. Luckily the game teases you with secret content if you manage to beat the last boss with just one continue. Even in Novice mode this proved to be a challenging task. But the thrill and rush I got when I reached that last boss on my first continue, beat him and faced the true final boss really was something amazing. A myriad of bullets flashing and homing on me, as I held on for dear life with one life left. Beating that boss on my first try totally made the game worth it for me.  After that, you have the Arcade mode and the even harder Unlimited mode , which I have no chance of beating on one continue an im totally fine with that, and other modes that slightly change the way you play the game. People like to be elitists about Dark Souls being a game for 'real gamers' and 'not for casuals', but this game makes Dark Souls look like a Kirby game. Only a handful of players will master this game.  Buy it for a well spent weekend, and if you enjoy it as much as I do, you might find yourself spending time trying to beat Arcade mode in one continue, even if deep down you know your hands and brain have no chance of dodging every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bullet the game is throwing at you.  10/10 would scream at my screen again",1,1

253710,theHunter Classic,"This game is 2 ♥♥♥♥in dope. I thought this game would be a simple hunting game similar to the Cabelas series but oh golly was I wrong. I was walking through the forest hunting for a bear when I stumbled uppon this green thing, when I approached it it was a weed plant. When I looked at it a message appeared and said 'Do you want to enter 420 mode, once entered you will never return?'. I was scared but I decided to press yes. Right when my finger was about to hit the left trigger I heard a voice say 'What are you doing in my swamp', I nearly fainted from fear. It was Shrek, I was just about to quicksope him when he jumped off a tree stand doing a 720 noscope headshot and rekted me. I cried in my bedroom for many hours before I decided to play again, this time with revenge on my mind. When I returened to Shreks swamp I discovered that Shrek had stole the weed plant and used it himself. I researched what would happen if you entered 420 mode and I learned that once inhailed you would become the ultimate quickscoper and rek everything in your path, even hackers with god mode would be rekt. I felt hopeless, but help woud soon come. I was on a hunt for a turkey when I found a mystical cave, I didnt know what to expect but I went in. I saw all these pyrmids on the wall, It turned out to be a iluminaty base. I teamed up with them and they told me that there was only one thing that coud defeat Shrek, the power of the dew. They told me where Shrek was and how I had to defeat him, and they told me if I failed I would die for good. I literally had to climb a mountain in the game to find this magical liquid, getting attacked by many mountain lions and mountain goats, but I made it. I drank the sugary liquid and what I experienced I will never forget. I morphed into sanic da heghog and with lighting speed I rushed off to Shreks new base. Shrek was waiting for me super blazzed and we went to battle. I was still upset that he stole my weed plant and I beat his ♥♥♥ super good, 'You little cheeky ♥♥♥♥ I'll rek you m8' 'Does you even lift ♥♥♥♥♥♥' I told him. I did a beastly 1080 spin and did a dolpin dive and I shoved my intervention up his ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥ hole and blasted him with the most beast head shot ever.

391540,Undertale,"The sight of such an expertly crafted RPG fills you with determination.  I remember hearing about Undertale a long time ago, but until it's release I had forgotten all about it. After seeing it's name posted literally everywhere I went on the interwebs, along with nothing but praise for the game every where I saw it, I knew that I had to give it a try.  I have not been disappointed.  Great classic game music, expertly written dialogue, unique battle mechanics, and endless hilarity at every turn; Undertale is proof that the quirky JRPG genre still works as a game medium when created with care and respect to it's predecessors. Following in the footsteps of games like Earthbound (or the Mother series in Japan) it bombards you with silly characters, hard emotion, and bad puns.  I don't want to spoil anything and there isn't much I can say that wouldn't spoil at least a small part of the game, so I'm not going to talk about the battle system, story, or even anything about the actual game.  All I can say is to look at the store page, but don't read too much into it. If that doesn't interest you at all, then all I really have to say is give it a try anyways. If you need some convincing, there's a demo available: play it.  Honestly, what this game does is worth more than a paltry $9.99. Even if it's not the longest RPG (you could beat it in a day if you really wanted to) it's designed to make you want to play it multiple times and even expects you to.  Anyone who enjoys classic console JRPGs (or Earthbound for that matter) will enjoy this lovingly crafted work done mostly by one person. It's the Cave Story for a new generation. Even if you don't like old RPGs, this game is so infectiously enjoyable you may just become a fan anyways.  Play it, and be good...",1,0

Would it still be fun without the highs and lows of surviving in a creepy and unforgiving land with only my wits? And while the terror of surviving alone disappeared with more people... the fear of other people quickly replaced it...  One friend dragged a pack of wild dogs back to the base camp after he started losing, killing half the team in the process... he never really apologized for that. Another got lost in the dark and started a forest fire to find their way back to base camp one... we now live at base camp two. And yet another went insane and began fighting shadowy terrors that none of use could see, so to us it looked like he was running around base camp swinging at the air and screaming about demons... it takes a game like this to actually make you consider the fact that your friends actual sanity might have drained along with their avatars.

Building decks is really fun, as you have tons of card to choose from and no one feels overpowered ( so far ); when someone seems unbeatable is just because you didn't build the right deck.  The best part of the game is the simoultaneous turns. It adds the bluff element that makes you go  YES!  when you trick your opponent or predict his next move and counter it.  Unlike Earthstone  the game doesn't feel unfair and random.  The only flaw that I can point is the feeling of an unfinished state.

209000,Batman™: Arkham Origins,"There is just one major bug (during the final boss fight - you will know it when you get there) with this game and the fix is rather simple. You need to go into the file called 'DefaultInput.ini' and check to see that these two lines are there:   .Bindings=(Name='NumPadThree',Command='DebugCameraZoomOut | OnRelease StopDebugCameraMovement') .Bindings=(Name='NumPadFive',Command='TriggerQuickStrike | QuickGadgetX | DebugMenuSelectX | CancelBatarangCamera | Button aQuickStrike')  For some reason the defaultinput.ini file does not have that second line which you need for the final boss. If adding that back in does NOT solve your problem, then reduce the resolution to it's minimal settings and try that. If you have both fixes going and that does not work, good luck because that's all the help I can give.  Origins does a couple of really neat things gameplay-wise on top of Asylum and City, but the story itself is more of a world-building exercise than the more gripping intrigue that you see in Asylum. It also contradicts a couple of points from Asylum, but if you just want the gameplay, well you've got more of it.",1,0

And what I really dislike is what Square Enix did with this great game.  - Crowd-Pre-Order (Augment your Pre-Order) Campaign - Adding a pointless Free2Pay-Game inside a Full-Price-Title - Adding even more pointless Microtransactions to the Single-Player-Campaign - Enabling the Shop-System AFTER the Reviewers were done AFTER the game was released to the public - Cutting out the 'Pre-Order-DLC' from the Main-Game, so you have to play it separately, so it makes absolutely no sence it to play it BEFORE the Main-Game because of getting spoiled what happens there and not after, as it already happened. Remember 'Missing Link' anyone? Just worse - The ending of the Main-Game might feel - somewhat incomplete. Because the story goes on - for the season pass owners, like the Episodic release of Hitman, of course with larger Episode I...  So do I regret I bought this? Pre-Ordering it? Yes, of course! It won't happen again. No because this is a bad game. It just fewked up by the publisher - Square Enix.

388970,iZBOT,"Everything you expect from a platformer in a neat little package. This definitely isn't a big game. Completing it, getting all gems (although the achievement didn't unlock), and optimizing my time in a few levels took me around 4 hours — and I'm probably somewhere between mediocre and decent at precision platformers.  The controls are tight and responsive, the speed is good, and the levels are well-designed, so you can mostly go as fast as the game allows and not have to wait for moving parts of the level to let you through. And most important of all, it's fair. While you may have to play a level a few times to become familiar with it, the game never just kills you for no reason, and there's mostly no blind drops or anything of the sort. You'll still die probably thousands of times just because you know you can do a level just a liiiiittle faster.  So yeah, if run n' jump precision platformers is your kind of thing, you'll most likely enjoy this — because it's a run n' jump precision platformer and a very decent one at that.  3 very minor things though:  - the bosses are maybe a bit lackluster. You'll be spending most of your in-game time outside of boss fights anyway, so it's not a huge deal really.  - hitboxes seem to be a little bigger than you'd expect. It's something you get used to after a while, but it confused me at first  - the gems seem to only serve to unlock an achievement (which didn't unlock for me for some reason). It'd be super nice if they served some purpose within the game too.  Apart from that, a thouroughly enjoyable platformer that should satisfy the cravings of most platforming enthusiasts for a little while.",1,0

For the price it is now, it feels like I am ripping Arkane off in a massive way (seriously). It is just that good.

436300,NA,"Ohhhh boy.  Impulse is a VN/Detective mystery about a college band in Seattle trying to solve a series of local murders. This constitutes randomly clicking words and objects until you figure out whatever obtuse line of reasoning the game wants you to pursue.  The UI is horrific. Buttons aren't lined up, there's huge amounts of white space, the text log is almost unreadable.  The voice acting is weak. Chris in particular is the worst offender, reacting to dead bodies with the same enthusiasm most people would give a stubbed toe.  The basic character art is okay but the CGs vary wildly between 'pretty good' to 'horrific non-Euclidean monstrosity'. (The CG where you play video games with Laura will haunt my nightmares for eternity.)  The music was forgettable. As in I don't remember a single track.  But worst of all, the story is completely nonsensical. Several plot points are raised only to be completely abandoned, the romance segments feel horribly tacked on, there's absolutely no concept of pacing, and the final plot twist has absolutely no buildup and basically means everything you did throughout the entire game was a waste of time. For the morbidly curious -   it turns out that every murder in the game was committed by the protagonist's mother, a woman who is currently UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR TERMINAL SKIN CANCER.    I burst into laughter when this happened. I was hoping this game would be decent enough, and I picked it up in an IndieGala sale for $4. Even that feels like a ripoff now, and if I'd paid its full asking price I'd be demanding a refund.  tl;dr Do not buy this game. Especially not on impulse. [/hahahathankyoui'mhereallnight]",-1,1

It's probably the best PC port Koei did so far. It looks good, has plenty of options (no ingame AA though) and on my system it is running perfectly smooth. Gameplay wise it's really what you'd expect form a Warriors-like type of game. If you think spending 95% of your time slaying through hordes of cute designed monsters is boring, then this just isn't for you. I like it however. Also there's a decent amount of light RPG elements - leveling, skill trees, crafting etc. Nothing really complex but it doesn't have to be for this type of game.

I like the idea that it is centered around speed and going faster, but for people with lower standard PCs, like myself, it's hard to play the game sometimes when your going too fast and your PC can't handle it.  The graphics menu isn't the best, but it's better than a lot.  And as TotalBiscut would say, 'You call that an FOV slider?'. But seriously, the highest FOV doesn't really do it for me. It's harder to see things with the highest desplay of FOV, which is a little saddening. Nevertheless the game is very well done, graphically (if you have a GTX), and gameplay wise.

If you like the idea of a NES-esque platformer, but are put off with the low-effort titles that have flooded the market, I'd recommend this game to you.  Pros: Great feel, devs painstakingly recaptured the look of an authentic NES title. It features a CRT emulation (default is off) which is nice looking instead of comically overdone. Beyond the aesthetic, the game is a sprawling, secret-ridden expansive world where every level is exciting to explore. The music fits very well. The sound design is great and captures the feel of old NES titles. The atmosphere of the game is haunting, in the same way how Castlevania just really nailed the feel.  Cons: It could use more challenge. Challenge-wise, it feels more like a modern handheld Castlevania title than the original NES. Those were tough, and I miss that when I play this. EDIT: They came out with a new challenge mode, so this may be out of date.  If you're into old-school gaming, love the NES and appreciate a well-produced game, I would recommend this 100%.",1,0

The price is fair, so, I won't doubt to recommend it if you find it on sale.  Besides being a bit short, I didn't find too much replay value on the game, so I would say that's the only drawback.

The long review: This is a lovely game with a lot of great potential. However, I was also very disappointed with it. I was expecting a semi-lengthy game and I completed it (and went back through for two chapter-specific dreams) in 3 hours. I would have loved to see the story fleshed out more to give it a fuller experience because it felt there was still some disconnection between the dream stories and the main protagonist. The gameplay was also pretty slow (regardless of the settings). The unresponsiveness, camera switching, and invisible walls not flush with the graphics made moving around a bit annoying and resulted in unnecessary death or the need to restart a puzzle. Despite all of this, I still enjoyed it enough to recommend. I was just disappointed in how short it was. It didn't feel challenging or difficult, but it was engaging.

Also after building the thing to hell I noticed in the loading art a DOHC V8 is being dropped into the magnum (but I can't do that, only OHV swaps).  Tips from a beginner: - 9000xp is a grind, but the game gets a lot more fun once you have a garage and can hit the auction up - Buying a 1/5 star auction score and restoring to 100% perfect seems to rack up faster profits than answering the phone (or at least it is more interesting) - Save your cash for 9000xp+ - Repair upgrades will save you quite a bit of cash, max asap - Carb and EFI tuning: get 2-3 bars lined up then work the last one to 18% while incrementing the 2-3 together  9/10 will be doing more (haven't even began working the DOHC V8's yet, 50 hours in, 400k~ cash as of this comment).  For the devs: the 10/10 would come if I could swap nearly any engine into any thing without having to modify the game files (with some sensibility, but a V8 maluch sounds like a blast). Also more modding and tuning options would help (11/10 if I can turbo or twin turbo anything).

But the first half of this game is So Bloody Good! It has story! It has characters! It has non-violent solutions if you're a social character! It has sneaking solutions if you're a stealth character! It has hacking and knowledge solutions if you're an intelligent character! Remember how everyone praised Deus Ex for having all these things? Multiple solutions to problems that allow your character to focus on things other than shooting and stabbing? This was like that, only you drink blood!   Then there's the last half of the game... You can almost feel the moment that the money runs out and Activison come knocking at the door, demanding the alpha build be put in stores tomorrow. There's a perceptible shift from multiple solutions, story focus and character driven conversations into: 'Go to this place and kill everyone. Enter this 5 x 5 room. You see 3 orcs, roll to hit the nearest one!'   This game was almost something very beautiful but, like a relationship with a shallow woman, it just needed more money thrown at it! Like heating a microwave dinner, it really needs more time than they gave it.   Buy it on the cheap, patch the game, play the first half...

208750,Apotheon,"Overall I give this game a 8.5/10 and would definetely reccomend you buy it if you like Platformers and/or Greek Mythology  If you want to know why, continue reading.  Compared to other platformers, Apotheon's combat system is amazing, there's an endless combination of weapons and legendary weapons (with their respective affects) to find and evetually, break after beating in someone's skull. Not to mention armor and health upgrades that can not only be found completeing the main quest but in secret stashes and lockboxes hidden off to the side. Enemies are incredibly varied, besides the fact that they all wear red, and none of them will act alike.  The only major problems I had with this game is that every single mission in this game is a 'Fed-Ex' quest, you go to retrieve an item from a God, and that God or their underlings sends you off to go do some ♥♥♥♥ (the only exception being Apollo, because he's an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) and then you come back, fight a boss, then get the item. All the items give upgrades and you feel accomplished after getting one, but then you remember that you still have to get items from 11 more gods. You might as well carry a checklist while playing this game. The only other annoyance I had was with enemy AI, the AI for the larger enemies (Bosses, Cyclopses, Weird half-animal dudes, etc.) is great, because you can wittily outmanuevur them and shove your spear in their asses. The AI for smaller enemies isn't that great, all of the normal enemies will engage you with whatever weapons they have, and thats it. Enemies like Apollo's Guards will randomly decide to attack you with a bow, drink a potion, run away from you until potion runs out, pull out their sword, stab your toe, and then run away from you again. And obviously there's tons of these guys in one area, so killing them is more of a chore than anything else. Wolves, who only majorly appear in one part of the game, will jump attack you, run as far as the can in one direction, turn around, attack you again, and then run as far as they can in the other direction before repeating everything else. You'd honestly have more luck just running away from them rather than wasting your weapons and armor trying to kill them.  There are some pretty great parts in this game though, in Artemis' woods, some nymphs ask you to clear their home of satyrs (Olympus is overcrowded with all of the deities moving in suddenly) and you walk in to promptly find a bunch of goat-men, drunk off their asses with erect ♥♥♥♥♥ (someone actually took the time to animated a ♥♥♥♥♥ on these enemies) humping the air and getting absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥d. How do you get them to leave? Smash all the alcohol. Once you do that, they get so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ they kill each other.  Oh, and the art style is pretty cool too.  Plot Synopsis:  You play as Nikandreos, a Greek normalfag from the village of Dion, one day, Zeus decides 'ayy lmao, humans are ♥♥♥♥' and orders all the other Olympians to neglect mortals. He also invites all deities living on Earth to come to Olympus, so that when all humans die off, everyone can go back to the Earth. Crops refuse to grow, animals disappear from the forest and even the sun lingers at one point in sky all day. Humans being humans, instead of trying to repent/stop the oncoming disaster, they decide that now would be a perfect time to steal everyone else's ♥♥♥♥. The game opens with Nikandreos stopping the pillaging of his village (and other things) by shanking every single mother♥♥♥♥♥♥ wearing a red tunic. At this point you go to the Temple of Hera where she appears, tells you to help the mortals and then sends you off to Olympus, all the while softly caressing your ♥♥♥.  You roll up on the Olympian Gates acting chill as a mofugga', and the guards who for someone reason, don't recognize you as a mortal let you in to the Agora, which acts as the overworld of the first tier of Mount Olympus.  I'd rather not spoil the rest of the game so I'll just say that Olympus is full of fly honies, and that ♥♥♥♥♥ Athena got ♥♥♥ for days.",1,0

235600,Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Blacklist,"Overall I would rate this game a 8.5/10. Good graphics and sound to be sure, good realism. The controls get a bit clunky at times when dodge from cover to cover but it still works well. The AI in the game is pretty good. The voice acting is decent as is the story line. I got a good 20 hrs gametime out of it completing the campaign. I did a few of the extra missions given out by the other members of the team, but overall those missions were diifficult and annoying. Many of the missions really force you to use stealth because if you do not then you get ganged up on by another 15 enemies and little remote control car bombs rush at you from every direction. Some of these missions actually abort if you are discovered. I gave up on completing many of those becaue I would get to the end and not be able to finish.",1,0
517710,Redout: Enhanced Edition,"Great skill based hover racing game. The more time you put in, the more you get out of it. Getting a hang of the controls feels extremely rewarding. Plenty of Pros and most of the Cons are subjective/could be fixed with an expansion or patch.  Pros: -Tight responsive controls -Well designed tracks with plenty of verticality -High skill ceiling -Around 20 different tracks -Excellent sound design responds to your gameplay -Plenty of different vehicles and classes  Cons: -Few music tracks, becomes repetitive -4 track themes. Could be expanded for more variety -Only 3 control schemes, no custom key bindings -Lack of balanced powerups. You will end up only using 4 or 5 of the total 10 (12?) options -Limited vehicle customization. Just pre-set color schemes. There are a good number of these, but something like custom colors, or custom logos would be really nice  Once again, very good game, the Pros definitely outweigh the Cons, and I look forward to the dev's continued work on this game, especially if it can address some of the Cons.",1,1

98300,Toy Soldiers,"When one speaks of the first World War, it simply comes to peoples minds of heavy usage of trenches that streatched for miles. For some history buffs and on lookers, they would think the same, but they would also know the more in depth fact that millions of lives were lost from the half a square mile between the trenches, or in other various locations around the globe. And lastly but ultimately, generals on all sides treating their army as if they were toy soldiers. My point being: nearly all generals thought that every citizen in their home country would be so infurated with national pride that thered be an exspendable, almost endless supply of recuirts.   Unfortunately, this caused the deaths of nearly 11 million people.   Anyway, this isnt a history lesson. That was just a little historical review of the games appropriate setting for that era.  Normally when you think of someone making a WW1 game itd be, needless to say, boring since the whole thing was a stalemate and that it was, but engagements went on for nearly weeks upon months. In Toy Soldiers, the battles that are chosen for each level are very accurately selected, and even the historical date and location and even some promises made by some generals who were there. but if you thik youll be waiting for 20 minutes at a time for something interesting to happen, youll find yourself proven wrong. The levels, in the least to say, get very epic at times, not only in scale but to the point where your brain is operating to manage all the incoming enemy waves. And trust me, theres not jsut simpel infantry and occasional tanks, there are several kinds of Infantry, Armored, Airborne, even bosses that are sometimes extrodianarily hard to defeat and each havign a unique look and style.  Your mission, is simply to defend your trench *cough cough* Toybox *cough* from these waves. Even at your desposal are several kinds of Machine guns, AA guns, anti infantry guns, and even occasionaly player controled offencive-defencive airborne and armor units of your own. And the really exciting part is that each can be upgraded to better defend yourself, and it quickly becomes somewhat of a mian side priority next to defeating the enemy.   Since i want to wrap this up in seperate sections so i dont make you lost, ill say the final conclusion setences:  1st: Toy Soldiers is a simple game. its setting, objectives, and graphics are respectable but this game isnt really striding to become the top game of tower defence or what you have since it really dosnt feel liek tower defence all the time.  2nd: If you love the feeling you get when you play a game and get this really sensational 'buzz' or 'drive' to get your brain operating fast and your attentions faster, this IS the game for you.   3rd: I have to add this part so you dont feel that the games soundtrack is on a loop; the games themes are randomly picked everytime you go to the menu. And unfortunately, theres only 3. But all quite good to say the least. Not everybody loves vinatge music from the early radio or record player era but i certianly do. So if your into pre, post, WW1 music, or anything between 1914 and 1939, you wouldnt mind this too much at all.   4th: I cant really say anything for the multiplay since it never really felt satisfying. its cool to play Offencive Defencive but it seemed a bit alien. if it was faster paced, id give it a good word but its not really to my liking unfortunately. All in All, im in nuetral stance for its Multiplayer mode, and its more up to you as far as what you feel towards it.  So if you wanna pass the time a bit, Toy Soldiers, is definately a game worth the money.   PS: i wont be leaving a review for Toy Soldiers: Cold War mostly for the fact that it kinda takes an odd turn down a GI Joeish world. And after playing it during the WW1 struggle, it really dosnt feel cool to jump to the 1950s through 70's. World War One is kinda my only perf for it. Howver, i would LOVE to see a coastal defence expansion, or a more broad spectrum as afar as fronts around the world. it would add so much more to the devine scale of the First World War.",1,0
203810,Dear Esther,"Dear Esther has that whole 'it started the genre, but isn't a very good example of it' thing going on. This is the game that codified 'Environmental Narratives,' but its kind of a mediocre one. The environment is super pretty, but extremely empty. There is not much reward for exploration. The story is a little pretentious and pretty predictable. The game is at its best when its leaning into that surreal, dream-like feel, but that does not happen often enough. It is worth checking out at least once, but is too tedious to be worth replaying.",1,0

24010,Train Simulator,"I love this game. The sense of place can be fantastic and within the limitations of a computer you can really feel you are travelling by train. Not every technical aspect of real railways is present, but if you have a love of train travel this is the closet you'll get on a computer. A word of warning is necessary about the DLC; quality varies. Some is fantastic, some less so. It's also worth looking outside RSC for 3rd party products. I particularly like the sound packs from Steam Sound Supreme and Armstrong Powerhouse (for UK subjects), which can really bring out the sensation of noise and power that are railways.  In my experience this is now a very stable product, especially with TS 2014. Two things I would recommend: getting a capable PC, so you can really whack up the video quality and ruinning it from a solid state drive. The latter eliminates the sometimes tedious time waiting for it to load.",1,0

201210,Pox Nora,"Have been playing since before Steam release. Pox is a tabletop card game. Pox has an awful reputation because of SOE's running it into the ground, but the new owner, Desert Owl Games, has gone an excellent job at reviving the game and lifting the crushing Pay-To-Win model.   This is a strategy game and the average game takes 30-45mins. After the tutorial, the player needs to buy card packs, and it can take time to build up a playable deck. Patience is required, but with the lucrative daily challenges and campaigns, it doesn't feel monotonous or grindy at all. I very much enjoy this game and recommend it to players who enjoy these genres.",1,0
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"Just to be clear, I love the Arkham games, I am biased on their favor. I played the last 3 games multiple times and got all achievements for them (except origins, because multiplayer).  I am VERY excited to get through Arkham Knight, but it's ture that the performance issue get you out of the experience so very frequently that it's just imposible to ignore it.  I'll still play it, unlike others I still love this game and can see the gem under the performance problems. I will wait for a resolution to the problems as I see it has been officially acknowledged by WB  That out of the game, the game keeps everything very safe when you play with batman. It's very similar to the past games, an evolution more than a revolution, and that is perfectly fine with me.  The Batmobile is very fun to use for chases, it's also cool as a tank, but it feels VERY out of place as a tank. It's like playing a shooter, which is not what I expected from a Batman game at all, no matter how good it is.  I still need to get further, so I might come back to edit this, but these the initial impressions for the most part.",1,1

292480,Magical Battle Festa,"In this game's current state there are a lot of problems... It's a pretty simple 4-player battle arena with dodgy controls (read: there's no tracking even on locked on opponents). Probably would be pretty fun regardless playing as intended with four people, but a lot of the stuff in the game is broken. There are three real killer problems here...  First, the game crashes a lot during battles. Seems to come out of absolutely nowhere. It's always disappointing when you're beating a cheesy boss or fighting a tough battle and winning and the game just stops working. Once or twice is bad enough. Often is not acceptable in any game.  Second, there are controller issues. The configuration tool is bugged or something and binds anything you put into it into different keys a lot of the time. Fiddling with your controller for half an hour when you don't like the controls really is inexcusable at all. I don't even understand how something like that can happen.  Third, and the worst offender is the online. The online is absolutely terrible. If you're not one of the people having an issue with black screens and actually get to play (I can, but I've only been playing with one other person), the netcode can do very, very strange things at times. I've had times where I can't move, and then get to move super speed after. My friend claimed he got hit all the way across the map by my super. Things that connect that shouldn't do and vice versa. On top of all this you can only play one game after making a lobby; if anyone attempts to return to lobby instead of leaving netplay the game flat out crashes for everyone.  There are other problems but those three are bad enough to kill it for me alone. Given that there are no other games like this on Steam at the moment this seems like it would be a slam dunk but the developers clearly needed to do more testing before release. Game was patched about a month ago as of this writing so there's hope that it'll be fixed, but right now it's definitely not a recommend from me.",-1,1

215530,The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing,"Rating 8.5/10  Overview Action Role Playing Game  The Good:  +Both on a technical and artistic level the game provides good graphics and atmosphere. The game mixes fantasy and steam punk together very successfully creating a dynamic and unique world to explore  +One thing that really stood out for me was the location variety. There are plenty of areas to explore each with its own uniqueness to it. You could be in a dark forest in one area and in a mechanical city the next and it all feels natural. I never felt like any location didn't belong.   + One of the most important aspects of an ARPG is the character building and this game does a fantastic job in that regard. The game has one class (3 if you have the dlc). Each class has 2 skill trees. In addition to basic attributes you can also assign skill points. Each skill has a few modifiers that you can invest points in further customizing your character. These modifiers can be activated by spending rage points which is acquired by defeating monsters.   +In addition to attributes and skills the game also provides you with auras and tricks. You can have 2 active auras with you at any one time and tricks (spells) further add to your character build.   + The game also provides perks, little bonuses to your character. The perks you unlock depending on how you spend your attribute/skill points and what you do in the game world. After you raise your reputation level high enough by defeating high level monsters you can unlock one perk per level for your character.   + The second biggest part of an ARPG is the loot and this game does a great job of keeping the loot you find interesting with plenty of bonuses attached to higher level gear.   +The game provides a companion in the form of a ghost who provides sarcasm and humor to the game. The companion is far from useless as she also levels up along with you. You can decide whether she is ranged or melee and customize her skills as well.   + The game provides controller support, using a controller switches the UI and menu screens to make it easier to navigate with a controller. I actually preferred playing the game with the controller over keyboard and mouse.   +The game provides an option for monster respawning which I thought was a great feature for this genre.   +The games checkpoint system always provides an easy way to return to where you die. If you die you have three choices, the first costing you the most money, respawns you where you die, the second costs less money but respawns you back at the last  nearest checkpoint and the last option costs no money but you respawn back in the city.   + The game provides a lot of post game content, scenario mode allows you to complete certain maps with certain conditions and unlocks higher loot.    The Bad:  -The game takes a long time to start up  -The game crashed a few times which annoyed me.   -You have to restart the game to switch between controller and keyboard and mouse.  -No build up to the end boss. I didn't feel like there was a dramatic lead into the final area. They seem to treat the last quest like any other quest in the game.   -Not so much a problem with the game per se but more of the genre, when you develop your character build the game can feel repetitive,   -co-op is not very active anymore  Conclusion  This game really surprised me, for an action RPG it is fantastic, and provides some new ideas for its time to keep you playing even after you beat the game. The game provides enough variety to experiment with different character builds to further add replayability. If you love this genre you will enjoy this. Enjoy.",1,0

I liked it.",1,1
206440,To the Moon,"This is the saddest 'game' I have ever 'played' on the computer. I use those two words in quotes because it isn't really a game, it's more an interactive story that you move through. Nontheless, it was a great 4 hour playthough that left me on the verge of tears. I had to eat beef jerky, while chewing tobacco, while cleaning a gun to stop feeling like a wuss after the game ended.   I nominated it for the 'I'm Not Crying, There is Something in my Eye' award.",1,0

214490,Alien: Isolation,"This is such a well made game. Looks fantastic and runs extremely smooth. It's not a short game either, expect around 20-30 hours of horrific entertainment. Interact with the environment, use stealth to your advantage and build your arsenal to survive the dangers of space. Even though I have seen the alien movies and knew what to expect, that alien still scares the living F%&amp;# outta me lol. If you enjoy horror at its finest...

275850,No Man's Sky,"No Man's Sky is every child that's stared up into the night sky and wished to take off and explore the Galaxy's dream come true!  With some bugs still needing a little polish on launch day, the dev team is easily forgiven considering their small number and the gigantic ambition of this game...which again to their credit, have stayed by our side the whole way, never leaving their keyboards to make sure we the fans are getting the best of what they promised. Maybe it's not everything, but it's early days and if this is the measuring stick on what we can expect, then my god, are we in for an amazing adventure ahead!!!  Contrary to unpopular opinion, their is a huge variaty in the game, and if you're not seeing it, then you just need to keep playing, as the variaty is out there along with the adventure!!  See you in the stars!",1,0
17410,Mirror's Edge,"Mirror's edge is uniquely frustrating. The aesthetic is wonderful; the cyberpunk city, the intriguing story, the beautifully rendered scenery. However the gameplay left a lot to be desired. The game starts off well, the free running aspect of the game is very smooth and rewards skill. However even early on I found myself with no real sense of direction, and I lost track of the amount of times I yelled 'Well where the HELL am I supposed to go now?' in frustration. On top of that, the gun-combat does not fit in with the game AT ALL, and those areas of the game where gun combat is MANDATORY (towards the end of the game) became tedious in the extreme. It's a real shame because Mirror's Edge has so much going for it, but I honestly can'y recommend it unless you pick it up for a greatly reduced price. I've heard the sequel is superior. We shall see.",-1,0

349720,Audition Online,"I have played this game for a long time. I have a lot of things to say about it but I didn't get to do for I'm afraid that they will ban me. They already banned one of my account like about three years ago. At the time, they didn't give me any chance. They didn't give me like a first time warning. If it happened again, they would ban my account or anything like that. So I find it a bit unfair. If they did such thing to other people, they are really biased. Today I try to log into that account and can't. I can't express how sad it is. I have put effort into my account playing and spending cash on it. No matter what, this is just an online game. There shouldn't be a policy like banning someone's account forever without giving chance.   Second, many players are incredibly rude and they are bullies. When I come into the room, they will make fun of my in-game name. Then I attempt to ignore them because I don't wanna cause any conflict. They said that I ignore them. What can I do? Replying to them doesn't help either. If they know GMs, they will get me banned but I wasn't even the one who started this whole thing. That's  not fair in any way.  Third, the players are very discriminating especially if you are new players or don't spend cash on your clothes and wear Beats clothes. They judge people by appearance and level. I'd appreciate it if they would just shut up and stop getting into other people's business since they do not have anything to do with them.   You can only enter the Event Channel only if you are level 21 and up. I don't see any reason for such a thing. Low-level players can't go to Event channel. I only see it as discrimination. The fact that they separate the Tournament channel into Beginner, Intermediate and Expert makes it discriminating. You can only join if you belong to that level. Or else go back to where you belong. That is a bit mean.   You are not allowed to play alone. If you play alone, you get no EXP so you can never level up. I find this policy absurb. Players have the freedom to choose whether to play with people or play alone. You can't force to do what they don't want to.   And the shopping mall. Oh my God! The prices are incredibly expensive. The cost for hairs varies. The cheaper ones are ugly. If you want a nice hair, it will cost you around $20 or more. That's just the hair! You also need the Top $20, Bottom $20, Shoes $20 and Accessories (hand-held $10 and a wing $20). The total is about $110 or more for only ONE outfit.   Many players play this game for a long time. They continuously support the game. Many are unable to afford BANA CASH. This game is free to play. This game is for teenagers. REDBANA should give away BANA CASH or outfits for these players who have supported REDBANA for so long.   The basic outfit is so ugly. It basically asks players to spend cash on their characters. But many can't afford. REDBANA should do something to help these players.   It wouldn't hurt to give away BANA CASH as this gives players a reason to play. I don't see anything wrong with that.    And the song. Oh my goodness! There is no variety. It is like they put random/trashy songs in there. You can barely find a Korean or Chinese or songs that are in other languages which suck. There should be variety.   And the updates are not regular. It is like all the things are up to them. When they want to have updates, there will be updates. If not, there will not. You can wait, wait and keep waiting.   Now REDBANA wants to release the game on STEAM. Oh please! They haven't taken good care of the game in the REDBANA website itself. How are they going to take care of both things?   I have no right to tell you to play or not to play the game. Experience it yourself and you will know what I mean.   Only if REDBANA listens to players' suggestions will the game succeed. Or else AUDITION ONLINE will only be stuck in this level without any improvement. REDBANA needs to regularly hold EVENTS like every day to liven up the game. Or else AUDITION ONLINE is so boring because players only play to level up.   HACKING issue too! Get 42million score on a MASTER song means you get all PERFECT for the whole song and maybe PERFECT x40. That is obviously impossible. But you will see that person around in the game. Why is such a hacker not BANNED yet? What are you doing REDBANA?",-1,0

314810,Randal's Monday,"Barring the possible subtext about adventure game protagonists (which may be entirely in my head), the game is artistically bankrupt – it copies ideas, spouts constant references in lieu of jokes, and features a story so flawed that even its own writers seemed to give up by the end of it.

237990,The Banner Saga,"Well this game has some very nice features but also big flaws. I really like the story, the characters are well develloped. There's a lovely viking fatasy lore that really got to me. I wish there was vocal dialogues though, not just text. Don't worry about bugs, didn't notice any problem.  I'm disapointed that you can lose characters kinda randomly, this is very frustrating considering you have to invest points in upgrading them. One sad thing though, is the turn mechanic, ally, enemy, ally, enemy...  no matter if you are 6 ally vs 2 enemies... totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ imo. After a few battles, you understand it's better to weaken enemies to 1-3 health (wich is also attack power) instead of killing them right now so that they take a turn without hurting you instead of their full health friends.  Still, I do like the game!",1,0

Although it looks gloomy and gritty, it sets the mood just right and puts attention to detail when needed, you will never miss an item or special event. Although it's nothing fancy, it helps set the mood for this game and it does a bloody good job too.   The gameplay is simple. All you do is click. It may seem a bit too simple but that's the genius part of it. It's so simple that you don't need to worry about controls while playing, which is a brilliant decision.  And finally, the story. Oh. My. ♥♥♥♥ing. God. Even though the story is simple, you can't tell what's going to happen next. I was astounded by the progression of the story and how my character was developing with every move I made. As the plot thickens, you will go on an emotional rollercoaster.

As good as this game is, there just isn't enough content to justify anything more than a few hours of play which is a shame as there is some imaginitive art design going on here. As is the case with a lot of procedurally generated games, the random nature of the game makes for a lot of replayability but the level generation follows quite samey logic and it never really -truly- feels all that randomly generated but hey.

I stuck with it when we were lied to and told that this version of the game would have parity with the console versions. I stuck with it when we were told that this PC port would be much better than previous titles. I stuck with it when consoles got multiple patches and updates before we saw even one. Shame on WB, and more importantly, shame on NRS. This is your product, this is your responsibility.   You will not see another cent from me purchasing any more Mortal Kombat titles.

Best FPS game outthere besides Ubisoft... Horrible bugs, hit registration is really bad, and just simple things like that make the game frusterating to play but I honestly think the game itself makes up for the fact that there are bugs every once and a while.

400170,The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing: Final Cut,"All the negative comments I've read have been about what the game used to be and what it was supposed to be, for me that does this game a huge disservice. The game as it is today is a solid ARPG with massive amounts of depth and really lets you tailor the character to your liking and avoids cookie cutter builds that MOST games are notorious for. If you are looking for a title to really sink your teeth into and get some serious hours out of, than this game is for you.  I picked this one up on sale for about 15 dollars American and would have glady payed the full 45 knowing what I know now about this title. While I will admit there are a few minor glitches here and their, It is nothing that takes away from the overall experience. Overall I would give this title a 9/10.

219150,Hotline Miami,"Hotline Miami is incredibly fun! The levels start off fairly simple, just a run in and shoot/slash up the place sort of affair, but as you progress the need to strategise increases, and you find yourself having to think carefully about the order in which you clear rooms. The faster and more efficiently you complete each level, the greater the score that you receive. This in turn allows you to unlock additional melee weapons and firearms, which then have a chance of spawning randomly in future levels (either on the floor of a room or in the hands of an enemy). I can't say I normally challenge myself particularly with video games, but because of the ease with which you are killed in Hotline Miami I found it exhilarating to burst through doors and hope I had taken the enemy by surprise.  The old school graphics are really awesome, and with the top-down style the visuals in Hotline Miami make me think of a cleaner-looking GTA. At the recommendation of other people I also bought the soundtrack, and I was definitely not disappointed. If you enjoy the sound of the music in the videos then I'd recommend purchasing the soundtrack.  I'm not 100% convinced I'd buy it again if it were full price (I bought it for $2.49) and I can't justify the soundtrack full price (also bought for $2.49), but this game is lots of fun so definitely pick it up while it's on sale!

The thing that convinced me to really give this game a change was when I landed on this amazing water world that just blew my mind on how awesome it looked. you could look in any direction and it would look like the cover of science fiction novel which is what hello games was going toward and holy ♥♥♥♥ did they pull off. plus the ♥♥♥♥ing scale of this game.

200510,XCOM: Enemy Unknown,"This is a cool tactics game, but not for the tactics. The game itself rewards you strongly for using a plodding, careful, and methodical approach to every mission -- trying to pull some kind of gambit rarely turns out well, and is never really necessary.  What's cool about the game is the connection it manages to build between you and your squad. Your dudes level up from useless to Rambo as they go on more and more missions, but when they die in combat they're done for good. The squad members even get random nicknames when they reach a certain rank, which is fantastic.   This connection brings a lot of tension into each mission, especially on ironman mode (no reloading saves), and as you focus so much on your squad you see amusing little storylines emerge between them. You notice that your assault guy 'Hardcore' always manages to stumble neck deep into trouble. You notice that 'Roadblock' has godawful aim, even if he uses the same random number generator as everybody else.  And then once you've already written you're own storyline, an actual scripted storyline peeks up out of nowhere and manages to instantly disappoint, but that's easy to ignore.",1,0

205100,Dishonored,"I haven't beaten Dishonored's main story as I'm writing this, but I'll start off with that first. The story is ♥♥♥♥ing useless. In the 3rd mission in the game, you beat it, and rescue Emily, your [spoileri]daughter[/spoileri] who is kidnapped at the beginning of the game. Then, the rest of the game makes no sense, as you try to clear your name as an assassin, by murdering/kidnapping/torturing your way to freedom! Speaking of freedom, you get a lot of it. In the ♥♥♥♥ing hub map, you get an entire open world to explore! And then, the powers are the best part. Get your infinite mana mods reasy, because these powers are amazing! Example of how I used powers to assassinate a target: I teleported into a window, through a door, poisoned the target's drink, and before his asssistant could call for help, I possessed a rat, and had it maul him to death, as I used slow motion to sprint past every guard in the area, and make it to my getaway boat before I got seen. Also, not killing isn't really that big of a deal, as the main thing it does is make more rats appear, and make more people get infected by the un-named plague, which cannonically doesn't even happen, so you can happily slaughter your way to victory. And the combat definitely needed work. The block/counter attack system works well, but punishes you if you want to play the game you want, becauase if you get ganged up on, you are ♥♥♥♥ed! You can't see what's behind you, and everyone has the same uniform, so you can't tell the gun wielding soldier from the normal minions, which makes sense realistically, but not gameplay wise imo.

Sure it's FREE and that's cool but it would have been nicer if they instead just fixed the issues with the original. F- LOL.",-1,0
412770,Boogeyman,Updated review The HTC Vive support is being added and although unfortunate that is was set to Vive compatible a bit early on the store page for a while I do believe the developers will iron things out with it so I wanted to come back and edit the review to a positive. The game does look fun and I will try to update again after it goes live for Vive.  Old review - When I purchased this game it was listed as HTC Vive compatible on the store page(now corrected). Stuck with it even though I had not played it at all because at the time of the refund request it had been a little over a month since the purchase. I do know it can be played on the Vive using Revive but thats like saying a Mac game is for PC because you can run it on a virtual machine like VirtualBox. Also it launches SteamVR everytime it's opened so the Vive turns on and the audio it set to it. If I close SteamVR the game closes so if I want to try the desktop mode I need to leave it running. I may edit the review if Vive support is added which seems like it should be fairly easy at this time due to the Unreal Engine OpenVR support.,1,0

49520,Borderlands 2,"This game is an essential to any PC gamer.  The intro and storyline are well thought out and beyond entertaining (I really enjoyed it a lot), the graphics look great and deliver well no matter how good of a PC you have and the combat never ceases to surprise you with new weapons and enemies. But sadly, like any other game, it has it's setbacks. Menus are probably the most annoying due their confusing andd hard to use interface. But multiplayer can get to be too easy or too head playing with friends any difference in level than you. I'd reccomend having friends of a lower level than you to join your sessions depending on how close in level you are, but if both of you are quite different in level, just don't play with eachother until you're within 3-5 levels of your friend.  Overall, this is still a great game with singleplayer and also multiplayer (you just have to know what you're doing).",1,0

239430,Q.U.B.E: Director's Cut,"Just saying that this game is awesome in many aspects. As strange as it may seem, the story begins pretty simple but later it turns quite tense and exciting. As for the puzzles themselves, they are not extremely complicated, but I would define hte most advanced ones as thought provoking. I really liked the progression of the game, and how it keeps adding new and interesting elements for puzzle solving. The setup is also pretty impressive and well made, with alot of detail put to the rooms and some of them are astonishingly gorgeous (considering how simplistic the game starts). The only thing that upsets me a bit is that sometimes the mouse clikcs are somewhat slow to control the movement of platforms.  Overall, an awesome game with lots of additional challenges to keep you entertained 9.8/10",1,0
232430,Gone Home,"Looking at reviews of this game, I was expecting a bit of a suspenseful adventure game that involved more exploration than combat. Perhaps I didn't do my homework enough. I got suspense, but it turned out to be false. There was no danger the whole time, but instead a somewhat hokey monologued love story instead. Every corner of the empty ominous house filled me with dread, only to find those feelings in the end were for absolutely nothing; it's just an empty house.  This game is getting appraise from indie gamers and hipster game critics alike for its subject matter and off-the-beaten-path (read: explore and examine items) gameplay style. Disregard this. If you want this sort of game, go buy Dear Esther immediately and get a much spookier, better written, more beautiful and engaging game. People seem to go nuts about Gone Home for the way it approaches story, but as a long time adventure gamer, I came out of this very disappointed I even spent $10 on it. You spend a little under two hours going through a deserted house reading scrawled notes and throwing every item out of drawers, making a mess of the place. If you really want to see what the fuss is about, wait til it drops to $2.50 or less. Otherwise, get a Telltale game, Dear Esther, or virtually any other adventure game on Steam for a better experience. Stay away from this one or proceed with caution. 5.5/10.",-1,0
225360,DARK,"Oh my lord. Where do I start.   unskippable, long, dialogue. Many, many lines of boring, cheesy text....   forced to push through a hobblingly slow character, boring dialogue, run-here-run-there gopher nonsense that you don't care about, all without getting to see if you will like the stealth mechanics or not, for about 20 minutes.   Very, very poorly optimized. I had to nerf the graphics settings into the ground in order for this sham to not melt my gpu. Granted my gpu is old and kind of sucky, but the level of graphics were no where NEAR good enough to justify the massive system resources being used. However, I can say that even at low settings, the graphics looked almost exactly the same as on high.   The voice acting is horrible... some of the worst...  The voice acting in this game seems like a Saturday Night Live sketch making fun of bad voice acting. It's more humorous than real. The sad part is it isnt charmingly bad, it's just bad. And the characters seem boring, unoriginal tropes, and unrealistic too. When have you ever known an owner of a club to be like 24 years old? Being a vampire game doesnt mean you have to make EVERYTHING outside of believeability. How about street bums, who all pack automatic handguns... who always keep them in their hands... who try to mug you by asking for spare change? wtf? This game feels like it was written by a 9 year old who thinks they know what the world is like, but is way off.   Have these people ever been in a real night club? You don't talk in nightclubs; if you need to communicate you shout right into the persons ear, and usually have to repeat it 3 times. Thankfully in this game, the club music automatically goes to half volume when you talk. Lol. Yea how immersion breaking is that. And then they just tell you they dont have time to talk anyway.   Everything in this game just wants to waste your time and not move forward. I'm sure things happen later but... I'm not going to stick around to see what they are.    DESPITE ALL THIS, I waited to see how the stealth would be. And the first thing they tell you is 'If you enter an opponent's field of vision, your vampiric powers will prevent him from noticing you immediately'  ..............this has to be the stupidest 'stealth' mechanic I ever heard of. So if they see you, they dont see you for a few seconds? Again... a 9 year old wrote this game. And it shows.   The game has very bad presentation, and wishy-washy stealth mechanics that make you achieve no real stealth. It's just nothing. The characters suck, the optimization sucks, and there is so much boring text.  I really think this is not worth anyone's time. I'm glad I got this in a bundle and didn't pay much for it. Do not buy.",-1,1

It is a great game that requires little strategy. Has some challenging parts here and there but ultimately is just a great game to pass the time. Playing by yourself I'd gice it a 6/10, but with a partner or group it easily ranks an 8.5+. Not the greatest in depth story. No true character development outside of learning new spells.

203160,Tomb Raider,"Oh wow where do I begin.  I first had the chance to play this game two years ago when it was relatively new. I played this game in an internet cafe that had to reformat everyday at 4am. I didn't know this at that time. I played in that cafe for hours, having a decent 27% progress. I thought I could finish it in a week, just playing it there. When I found out the save game have been removed, I got pretty sad tbh. I promised to buy this game and play it and finish it the moment I buy my own laptop/pc. Thankfully my boyfriend sent me a game copy on steam, knowing how much I loved it. I finally had the chance to have my own laptop and played it and finished it.  This game is just amazing. I'm really glad they made Lara this way. I havent played the old TR games so I can''t really compare the gameplay and puzzle difficulty and the Angelina Jolie movies didn't appeal to me as much so this was a breath of fresh air.  This Lara is vulnerable. She's not the killing machine she's portrayed in the movies/old games. She feels human and relatable. Maybe that's one reason why I love it so much that I actually cosplayed as Lara Croft. I may be playing this again on a harder mode. I keep going back to this game, just trying to get the 100%. It's always fun. The art is also nice, that's one thing I find in games alluring.The soundtrack is also very fitting. Overall my experience in this game is really great.

383870,Firewatch,"An amazing experience, while it lasted. 3.5 hours playtime and i have reached the conclusion of the games storyline.  From the perspective of actual gameplay this game sits in the 'very average' catagory. Its an open world that isnt trully open, you cannot walk through a bush or over a small rock for example, and by and large have to follow pre set pathways and routes.  BUT...and its a big BUT...  This game has a FANTASTIC storyline and the dialogue is exceptional (assuming you dont mind a bit of foul language). There is not 50 different characters as there are in some games but the few there is are done very well and keep you gripped throughout.   If you enter this game with the mindset of it being an interactive story you will certainly enjoy it, if your looking for a immersive gaming experience you may be a touch dissapointed.   Seen some reviewes about the game engine causing performance issues and low framerate, have to say apart fromt he odd little drop here and there the game ran nice and smooth for me.   With more development and more attention to making the open world trully open this game could have been a true masterpiece that would be remembered for a long time, would have been more than willing to pay AAA price for it too. However it is just too short and not quite enough freedom is given for it to be a true great.  This said, for £14, and purely for the story alone (which i will point out again is AWSOME - even if its only 3/4 hours long) it is well worth having in your steam library.  10/10 - For the story 5/10 - For the Gameplay  7/10 - Overall",1,0

The game managed managed to keep me playing the entire way through and the tension did not decline at all. The atmosphere and the story is going to keep you going to the end.  The only downside to the game is the length, but they surprised me how well you can fit story in such a small space. I played for about 1,5 hours and i am sure you can uncover all the secrets of the game in 2-2.5 hours.

45770,Dead Rising 2: Off the Record,"So yeah. This is my first review, but then, this is one of the games I know intimately well. I may only have about 16 hours on record here, but I've logged far more on the 360 version.  The Dead Rising series seems a bit schlocky, and that's not surprising. It's meant to be a tongue-in-cheek take on zombie outbreaks. It remains serious enough to have a cohesive plot, but not so serious that a lot of the bosses and scenarios you encounter seem far-fetched or histrionic.  The fun very much comes from having a whole playground of casinos, mall shops, and an added amusement park to formulate weapons and combat them. In addition to that, you'll encounter a lot of survivors who need to be brought back to the safehouse.  Then there's the sandbox mode. It takes out the merciless clock and timer that often impeded your missions in Dead Rising 2 and the original Dead Rising. That really allows for it to be your playground.  There's a bit of humor, a bit of sexy, a 'reality' TV show that glorifies zombie-killing in a WWE-type format. And what's more: Frank West returns in the Off the Record rendition.  Some of its reviews both here and elsewhere tend to be a bit negatory because DR2:OTR took so very much from DR2... so much that, heck, a lot of it's exactly the same. But what OTR really does is fine-tune, improve, and give a little more freedom. It makes it a lot more fun. It's what kept me coming back.

257850,Hyper Light Drifter,"As you probably have seen before, this game can remind you of old zelda. it does but in a really good way.   They have gone over their heads with the art work. I stopped in many locations and just thought to myself 'that's a damn masterpiece in the background there.'  The game mechanics are so fluent that it actually feels like you are in the battle. you get upgrades as you go on and helps. but the skill you need to develop to take down some seriously challenging bosses is all on you.  The game is very unliner and alot of secrets around that you need to be scrap on the eye to spot, that is a bonus in itself. highly recommend this game and to just say i am really really pleased whit my purchase.   To the developers i just want to say you really made a star in the game gallexy whit this one!  cheers!",1,0

Concerning performance on a 4790K 980GTX SSD I've turned down AA to FXAA and shadows to high due to some weird camera stuttering in the intro part of the game, everything else is running at max.

320300,Car Mechanic Simulator 2015,"After the first few cars that come into your shop for repair, you've got the concept down. After you unlock a few of the basic skill unlocks, there's nothing you can't really solve. After you're able to buy cars at auction, that's it. You've reached the end game. By that point you're stripping cars down to bare metal and replacing them piece by piece, car after car, making unneeded profit on a hugely routine exercise. There's no real change except for which cars you choose to restore, and sell.   The money will never go towards anything but buying and restoring more cars. After you've done one or two, you've even unlocked all the points you need for the garage visual updates, and will have points to spare that you don't need. Buy car, fix, sell, repeat forever.  And so, I recommend this game. Which feels weird to me.  It's super repetetive. The DLC is kinda nice and not stupid-expensive, but doesn't add enough to be a game changer. Even the recent addition of Expert Mode hasn't really changed anything, as I've done enough of this to not need the non-expert prompts as to what to do next. But I keep going back and doing that repetition.  I guess in a way it's soothing, or at least I find it so. It's not like you're accomplishing much, but after a lot of (clicking only) effort, you've finished a nice rebuild of the car and can sell it and get it out of your workshop. Why does that seem good? I don't know. I can't say.  My biggest wish is that it went a few layers deeper. Like if I had to fix it all down to a new level of detail: not just replacing the headers, but how about all the gaskets too? Or the interior needs fixing (all cars, no matter how jacked at the auction, have perfect interiors). Or if I want to get a small, cheap car, and throw a turbo and lowered springs on it and sell it that way.   It's weird. I can't make myself hit the 'No I don't recommend this' button because I enjoy it, but there's so many caveats and missed opportunities I feel I should hit it.   I guess, in the end, it's a 3 out of 5 stars that I somehow can't stop playing.",1,0

213850,NA,"I am a fan of the Magic games but before I get into the guts of this review/ recommendation I have got to say I was pretty disappointed with Magic 2014. There was alot I didnt like about Magic 2014, one of the biggest was that there was almost no real freedom with deck builds, thats something almost unheard of in dcg (digital card games) or card games in general. Another thing I did not like was the graphics themselves, dont get me wrong I dont expect alot graphics wise from a dcg but a table and cards are the last thing I would choose to do If I could make everything look 'cool'. It is almost like playing Magic the tabletop card game through a computer monitor. Its fun table top but when your able to do all sorts of cool stuff with a computer and you choose not to, well it just does not seem like a good choice to me.   There seems to be alot of extra paid content as well, I haven't looked into that very far but I have heard some complaints. Overall you should try Magic 2014 if you are a fan of the series, or are looking for a payed dcg, but I bet you can find a FTP dcg that you will have just as much fun with. Lets hope the next Magic game ends up better than Magic 2014.   NOTE: I am adding this note to let you guys know that I did like the game. I got a comment asking me why I gave the game a thumbs up if my review was negative. I did like magic 2014 It just did not live fully up to my expectations, I have been playing a bunch of other free dcg and I know how fun/ popular the magic series is so I figured it would be 'better' than it was. I still liked the game.",1,0

382140,SKYHILL,"The main problem with this game is there is too much of not enough.  The game has turn based combat - but there is barely any strategy to it other than picking which dice to roll. There is nothing actively happening in these fights to make the player feel interested. All you feel is frustration over your health ticking down when there is nothing you can actively do inside or outside the combat system to better yourself.  The game has RPG stat elements - but they are probably the lamest, most simplistic I've ever seen. Leveling a character is so linear and obvious that it shouldn't make a player scratch his head any longer than 5 seconds to figure out what path to take (largely dependant on what weapon the game's RNG decides to give you early on). There isn't even any defense ratings for character or monsters, making the whole weapon/damage system feel hugely simplistic and unrewarding.  There's a crafting system - it's pretty bread and butter. The actual items you can create and variety isn't too bad really. But the way the game plays out just makes it another aspect that falls to the side as unrewarding, plagued by RNG happenstance, and rather pointless. It's true you will need to use it to some extent to make it to the bottom, but I doubt you would need to invest in much, which is good considering there is no active way to get materials you really need. In other survival games, you have areas that have greater or exclusive chances to wield certain items. This game it's all at the drop of a hat, and it completely makes the player feel void of any real sense of achievement, because they never feel like they are actively surviving.  The premise of the game sounds super neat - but in reality it's such a hollow rendition of what the game promises on paper. You have to escape a hotel from the 100th floor and get to the bottom. When you realize that each floor has two... yes, two rooms on each floor, I think that's when it kicks in how lazy, barebones and unadventurous this game really is. I'm also not sure what hotels these developers have been to, but this building barely even qualifies to be a crappy highrise in Newham.   In the end , this needed to be fleshed out, in all areas, by a factor of 10. The price of admission makes it clear that they're not even shy (or are perhaps ignorant) to have made such a minimalist and lacking game.",-1,0
24240,PAYDAY: The Heist,"Even if you get 3 human partners to take care of the AI-eats-their-own-♥♥♥♥ level of retardation, you'll still have to deal with poorly explained mission objectives and an overwhelming feeling of disappointment in the map layout.  Your activities for these 'heists' feel like a shoddily constructed GMod map: repetitive actions that require no real skill or puzzle solving from the players. All you have to do is keep hammering the 'make this ♥♥♥♥ go' button every few minutes, because obviously every piece of equipment you buy is from ACME's 'guaranteed not to kill you, we promise!' line of products.  And once you hit a certain point in the mission, you WILL have to start killing people with FPS controls and damage that feel serviceable, but lacking in style or tactics or any way to make it feel fun or once again, require effort from the player. You can't even take cover around corners...  Come on! No hacking minigame? No interrogation of guards or conversation trees to socially engineer a way in? You can take hostages, but its just another meter to fill...you can't negotiate with the cops to gain a tactical upper hand....  Every time I play this, I'm reminded why the Left for Dead series works so well:   1: Your goal is to simply survive. Valve set themselves up for a goal they know how to work with, and how to communicate to the player.  2: You are given many options to tackle any obstacle in your way, whether it be an enemy type, mission objective, player death, etc  3: The AI, while simple, can be used to your advantage. Need to get a character through to an area to complete an objective? Use a tool or create noise to draw attention elsewhere!  And then there's the 'go ♥♥♥♥ yourselves, developers' level of DLC for this ♥♥♥♥...Its never new levels or new game modes, just more gun porn and stupid costumes.",-1,0

I never really even nod towards games like this and I honestly didn't expect too much, but for some reason it was really different than the other games out there. I would easily recommend this if you're looking for a more story driven 'horror' game that you can formulate theories for during the next several weeks.   If you're looking to be scared though, it's probably not for you. It's definitely more atmosphere and narrative content which is meant to be appreicated and thought about. It's full of alot of human/existential/'self discovery' themes as opposed to jump scares - which just isn't for everyone.   It is pretty short which is sort of the downside, took about an hour and a half.  As well as the dialouge is sometimes pretty cringe-worthy.  But several hours later and I'm still left thinking about it and still wondering what the hell any of it means.",1,1

I really like that any deck is fair game; ie. there are no go-to decks that are a guaranteed win.  The more you play and unlock achievements (in game, not steam) you get more cards so it doesn't feel pay2win. There is a store available just like any other free to play game where you can buy booster packs, decks, and aethetic changes such as icons, card backs, and battlefields (the area in which the cards are played). All can be purchased with money or points you accumulate from playing.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"GTA Online: In open world most people are constantly running around killing each other. Missions, most people rush in and get themselves killed, or they stand back and leech XP, or it's disorganized chaos. It's only fun if you can talk your friends into playing with you, otherwise it's a mess. There are also a lot of non-English speaking players, people who keep their mic's hot or people who scream and cuss almost constantly. But with friends, doing missions, it's one of the coolest online experiences I've ever had, and that's the honest truth. So playing with randoms? 3/10. Playing with friends? 8/10. The missions are still a little repetitive until you level up.  Character creation is okay, but I've seen it done better. You choose a lineage; mother and father, and you can slide over from one to the other to choose which one you take after more. That's okay but the character models are pretty ugly for the most part. After that you can adjust a few sliders like chin, jaw, eyebrows, cheeks, mouth, nose, but it's still nothing even close to the options in games like The Sims or Saints Row. Outfits are unlocked as you level up, but even the starting options aren't too bad, at least once you manage to get to a clothing store.  I'd still pick Saints Row 3 or 4 as better games overall, but you can only do 2-player co-op in those. If you want to play with 2 or more friends, GTA Online is just about the best you can do. You do have to be level 5 before you can unlock PVE missions but it doesn't take long to get to 5. You can either join missions you get invited to (and you get invited to stuff constantly) or you can just do PVP missions or races until level 5. Beware though, if you see a deathmatch type mission advertising unrealistic amounts of RP (rep points, basically XP) or money, most likely it's an exploit. You'll go in there and end up getting killed over and over like fish in a barrel. Just stick to the normal missions.  GTA 5: The story is a little better than GTA 4. At least in this case you can kind of sympathize with some of the characters. It's still a sausage fest; no strong female characters and overall a very 'dudebro' tone. The world is amazing though, very well crafted. There's just so much detail everywhere, it's like nothing I've ever seen before. It's practically a simulation; very immersive.  I haven't experienced any of the crashes, hitching, or technical glitches like others have described. But I'm running an i7-3770k with 24GB RAM and a Geforce 670 w/ 2GB VRAM. I have to run textures on Normal; high or ultra high requires over 2GB of video ram. It works seamlessly with gamepad for driving/flying or kb/m for shooting. It doesn't seem to have aim assist like GTA 4 did when using a gamepad.  Collecting and customizing cars is more intuitive, and you can upgrade weapons too. They took a page from the Saints Row series here, but I still think it's better done in Saints Row to be honest. In that game, you have more granular options for vehicle and weapon upgrades, both functional upgrades and cosmetic ones.  Overall I'd give this game a 7/10, but that's just my personal taste. The online experience is very hit and miss, and the single player mode is a little too gritty and depressing, just like most GTA games. If you enjoy PVP and games where you play evil characters, this game is an easy 9/10 I think. But if you're more of a carebear like me, and you enjoy a more lighthearted tone, Saints Row 3 &amp; 4 are still the best open world urban mayhem games ever made.",1,0

218230,PlanetSide 2,"Heyyo, I love this game. They brought FPS together with MMO's and made it amazing. I love it more than the confusing and frustrating times I tried Planetside 1. The way everything is handled and the amazing hit registry even with hundreds of players active at a time is an achievement of its own that most other shooters struggle with and only have 16 to 64 players! The Forelight Engine which powers the game has an impressive display of graphics and the BEST particle effects in a video game to date WITH PhysX Apex Turbulence!? This game is already challenging World of Tanks for my favorite game and it only seems to be getting better and better in time. I'll be playing this game for many years. :)",1,0
242700,Injustice: Gods Among Us Ultimate Edition,"Would you believe me if I told you I only got this game so I could play as Scorpion from Mortal Kombat? No? Well you should, considering the only reason I bought my N64 was to play Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero! And the only reason why I bought my Playstation 2 was to play Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance (... and then Deception and Armageddon which followed after). And guess why I bought my PlayStation 3? You're right, to play Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe and MK (2011) after that.  This review is based on my playing as Scorpion. If you're good at Mortal Kombat (2011) then don't think you can pick up the controller and bust'a move in this game. The fighting style in this game feels flipped upside down. I'm not a comic book humper, so I can honestly say the story mode was boring. Playing as Scorpion felt awkward because I was too used to MK (2011)'s Scorpion. Playing this game was like when you cheat on the person you love. Afterwards you feel dirty, disgusting, and down-right pathetic. You end up running back to your real woman, and that woman is Mortal Kombat (2011).  I played maybe 5 hours on this? That's 5 hours too many. I'm glad this didn't break my wallet as the initial release's cost would have. Considering my purchase helps fund the creators of Mortal Kombat, I don't feel all that bad for buying this.",-1,0

316430,Battle of Empires : 1914-1918,"I'm finally gonna make my review on this sinking ship.   I loved the idea when this was a mod and I still followed it when it became a greenlit game. It is a fun and enjoyable experience at first but the gamemodes make little sence and get quickly boring if you're not playing with a very very good friend of yours. The gamemodes are not at all what you would expect and are really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when you take it in as a whole.  Cooperative could possibly be the only fun you can have for the duration of the campain but there is where we hit another problem.  Selling the SP missions as DLC really does it for me. Not only is the game lacking in content (It got the basics set.) but not being able to see what the devs have to show for is really disturbing when greeted by such a nauseating pricetag. Sounds are not great either which makes the super pricetag just a dealbreaker.   I have had a good good time playing this game when it was first released here on steam and I was actually looking forward to things. But now I'm just going to let it sink into the void and stop recomending the game for friends and mow players in general.  'Battle of Empires :1914-1918 is a story driven RTS, that re-lives some of the bloodiest battles of “The Great War”.' If you have the money to spend sure. I did and was severely dissapointed. 'The graphics have been developed to show the beauty and horrors of “The Great War”. ' Poor vissuals and awful sounds makes this beauty and horrors of 'The Great War' send real shivers down your spine and not in an exciting way.   3/10 because they added a Multiplayer-only for a low pricetag. Hell I got the game for 14 eu and that was high enough for this piece crap. -RuNNoLa",-1,0

214550,Eets Munchies,"Good for Kids or Tablets. Gets a bit 'harder' later on. but overall not my game. pass :)  The Pricing seems fair (~7€) but I would advocat for buying it on the -80% Sale. It just feels like a Tabletapp so much that its even refelected in the price I would pay for it if interested.   The Puzzles of the first World were so easy i burned them in under 20min. Thought I would play it to 100% during the 'play for free' event.... but then came World 2. It increased in difficutly, stayed fair and fun. Basic Mechanic is to find a way for Munchies to the final Cake. He can walk and run and eating things influences his behavior. But in World 2 I also noticed I didnt liked how items, shooting things/activating things, and munchies Pathfinding is handeld. Overall you have to make up a good plan at several stages by setting up the items. Then it gets to a hasted click Item 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 at sometimes very specific moments. For sure fun on Tablets but annoying af when doing it with a mouse. So its not a game for me cause of this buuuut...  - The Character, Level and Itemdesign is very well done and Munchie is a likable little fella i wouldnt mind seeing in another game (jump&amp;run for example). - The Mechanics are challenging with a fair learning curve - It has harder Challenges that can be unlocked (Wupwup, unlocks! :) ) - The Music/Ambient of the game is fitting and over the short period i tested it, I didnt made me turn it down for my own tracklist. Thats a big thing for a Puzzlegame i think.  Do I recommend this game? YES! I recommend it for: Children or Casual Gamers, hell even Streamers could enjoy solving the Puzzles onstream, while waiting for their main game to continue.",1,0

The gameplay is very well refined and the controls are perfect. In terms of story, Telltale has achieved something so great i cannot describe it. it pretty much captures the feel of the other Borderlands games and turns it into a Point&amp;Click/Choose your own adventure. The writing is perfect and the return of voice actors from the previous games is awesome.

That being said.Warframe is free, 100% free meaning there is no reason you shouldn't atleast try it. It is fun and simple, easy to learn but hard to master. There is no huge crazy storyline but the games is fun and has a HUGE variety of things to choose from, whether it's warframes, weapons, or even pets. Not to mention the fact the game is constantly updated providing new content that is also free. you can use microtransactions to speed things up and get a few aesthetic items that would other wise be unobtainable, but there completely aesthetic and, completely your choice.This game is by no means pay to win. Many say this game is repetitive, and at times it is, but it is as i previously stated it's constantly updated and this all depends on how much you enjoy playing the game. final verdict, warframe is fun, filled with variety and generally enjoyable. It still has a few problems but it is also still in beta at the time of me writing this so these will hopefully be ironed out. once again i cant recommend warframe anymore. And with that please remember this is my opinion and forgive any spelling or gramatical mistakes. Thank You",1,0

329690,BasketBelle,"I really enjoyed BasketBelle. One word I would use to describe it is charming. It's a short game, roughly 1 hour, give or take if you try for the final achievement, but it's very well made. This review is a short overview - there's not too much to cover given the game's length, but the execution and charm more than make up for it. Definitely worth playing if you already own it, or if you get on sale - the full price would be fine for people that don't mind game length so much.  The story follows a young lad trying to find/ rescue his sister after she is kidnapped. The story has lots of warm moments, and I was pleasantly surprised how in such a short span of time, such vivid feelings were conveyed. You'll see what happens when you play the game, there's not much to elaborate without giving away everything, but the story was sweet and warm.  The gameplay uses several mechanics of basketball, and the controls are fairly simple - run right and left, slide, and jump-shot. The simple controls are the basis of some puzzles in the game, and overall I found that it made sense that there weren't complicated controls. The levels all have some different settings and layout, and you'll get the general feeling once you play. Again I was impressed with how the devs progressed the levels and story, and they fit together nicely, in such a short span of time.  Overall, I really recommend this game - it's short but the story is charming, the gameplay engaging. This is an example of an indie game made with love and care, and it conveys the feeling to the player well.  ~If you enjoyed this review, please check out the  Completing the Backlog  curator page, for other nice reviews by me and others!~",1,0

294440,Shadowgate,"I think I must be the only reviewer who never even heard of Shadowgate and thus was not motivated to pick it up out of a sense of nostalgia, but because I thought the art was pretty and I heard that you could actually die a whole bunch. I've played plenty of point-and-click adventure games in the past and, with few exceptions, you're never really in any danger at all.  The basic setup is that you are a guy named Jair and you are the Seed of Prophecy, you're contacted by a mage named Lakmir who tells you to go to a castle called Shadowgate armed with only a torch, a dirk, and courage and defeat the evil Warlock Lord. It's not the most original premise in the world but it's a remake of a game that came out in the 80s, so I'll forgive the lack of originality.  As Lord Jair, your job is to navigate through the castle, room by room, grabbing items and stuffing them into your satchel You explore the castle by using various menu commands: look, hit, use, eat, etc. At first I found it a bit clunky, having to 'use' myself (or 'hit') when pulling a lever when other games would just let me use the lever by clicking on it, but I think the clunky interface is part of the charm. While you're exploring, you need to keep an eye on your torch and keep picking up new ones that you come across. If your torch burns out, well, let's just say the game warns you that bad things happen....  Besides exploring, the other thing you'll do in Shadowgate is die a lot. Taking the wrong item, using the wrong item, not wearing certain equipment (via using them on your portrait), and a myriad other things can prove fatal. There's even an achievement for uncovering all the hidden ways that you can die in the game. The funny thing is that as frustrating as dying is, in Shadowgate it's actually fun provided you save often. I found the autosave feature saved pretty frequently but I always saved as soon as I entered a room, just in case.   Graphically, Shadowgate mostly has static pictures and some animations, but I can honestly say that I don't think I've ever played a prettier adventure game. The artwork could have come straight out of a D&amp;D manual. Shadowgate definitely has the look and feel of an RPG but it's an adventure game, through and through. The music is also great. The main theme is my favourite but the tense track that plays when your torch is running low had me frantically scrambling to light a new one every time, even though I knew I had plenty of them.   One aspect of adventure games that I often have trouble with is the puzzles, particularly puzzles that require something I call Adventure Game Logic, that is, puzzle solutions that involve combining items in a way that makes absolutely no sense. Shadowgate takes a subtle approach to puzzles, dropping hints here and there and letting the player figure things out on their own. If you get stuck, you can always ask Yorick the skull for help. Since this was my first time playing Shadowgate, I decided to play on Apprentice (the lowest difficulty setting) and oftentimes Yorick would pretty much tell me the answer to a puzzle. However, sometimes he seemed to be jumping the gun a bit, like when he told me I needed to cross a certain bridge when I actually had to do a few more things to get the means to get across. Other times I was simply stuck with a bunch of items and no idea where to go next. This is one of those games that requires a ton of trial and error (or a walkthrough at the ready) which is compounded by the fact that the inventory is very disorganized. I lost track of how many times I remembered a passage in a book that was hinting about the puzzle I was working on and then not being able to find it in the archives. At times it seemed as if some information that would have been useful in other difficulties (the game closes off certain areas and puzzles are much easier on Apprentice, giving you some incentive to play again on harder difficulty levels) was just a bit confusing.   If you like point and click adventure games and you're willing to put up with a lot of trial and error (and dying a lot). I wouldn't recommend Shadowgate as someone's first experience with the genre but it is an interesting look at a piece of adventure gaming history. I will definitely be going back and playing it again on a harder difficulty level and I can't wait to see if they come out with more games in this series.",1,0

22340,Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth,"Despite modern technology, this game looks cool for our time. Rendering isn't perfect, this game has a few bags(sometimes they are very annoying, like a bug in the 7 chapter with invisible targets or an error, which doesn’t allow you to finish the game), but a story is exciting, interesting: unexpected events impress me, i should keep an eye on an every dialogue.  COC comprises puzzles, which arent very difficult, but they can take 5-10 min.  An atmosphere in the COC soaked with dusk, macabre sounds and fear.  This game contains action and stealth. In a few missions you have to use your weapon and your serpentine tricks.  I ought to mention that system of health is realistic: you took damage in a leg then you slower, you took a hit in a hand then you shoot slower. Sanity is valuable:for example, if you are scared you can not move or rotate with normal speed. There you can even fail a mission: mass sanity failure. An idea of the seaside city and of the taint in him was realized. There a lot of facts, which specify on a lovecraft’s innsmouth(persons, buildings). But a story line in a game and in a lovecraft’s work are quite different.  A genre of this game ranges between detective, horror and shooter(not like cod or cs). I can conclude that COC should be rewarded with applause and the highest rank. I should specify on a distributor (Ubisoft) and a publisher (Bethesda Softworks), which picked out this game. We know they are famous and they won’t pay attention on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.",1,0

461910,NA,"Alright, I won't lie, whenever I see 'Free to Play' on Steam I read 'Pay to Win', so I knew from the start what to expect and as a matter of fact, that's exactly what I got.  Setting aside the fact that it's more of a mobile game and definitely not something worth porting as a computer game it still is a good time waster. In fact it's even fairly enjoyable for the first couple hours of gameplay.   Progression's smooth, there's a good balance between whatever army you can build (for free) and the campaign difficulty, RNGesus' a ♥♥♥♥♥ but that's something we're all used to... BUT once you get past a certain point it gets more and more difficult to advance without spending money or mindlessly grinding like hell hoping for some good RNG procs.  PVP gets totally unbalanced quickly since buyers gets in the way (A single rank 5 unit which is part of the beginner's package, NOT maxed out, can take down your whole army nearly singlehandedly, warlord included, even though you have 3 times your opponent's level / army value... seriously?) which prevent's you from building up winning streaks, which prevents you from farming energy, a necessery component to upgrade your army / items efficiency. In other words, you NEED it, but you CAN'T get it if you don't pay.  Same goes for evolving your troops; grinding is all well and good as an alternative for smoking your credit card, but if you can't beat the level in which you can get the units you need and not some useless or sub-component grunt, what's the point?  Those are the reasons why I can't recommend this game. If you aim to waste a dozen or so hours it's fine, but don't expect to progress any further without spending something (not necessarily hundreds of bucks, but at least some).",-1,0

4000,Garry's Mod,"By far the best sandbox game I've ever played, with fully customizable gameplay from maps to weapons, controls, HUD and even your controls and movement on some custom gamemodes.

Full mod support, of course the whole game is a mod on HL2, so that's a given, pretty much anything you want in the game will be on the steam workshop and can be installed safely with one button. Although a lot of the more niche mods were lost when  garrysmod.org  got shut down, the workshop is still alive and well and new uploads come in every day so soon it may be the same as  garrysmod.org .  Basically this game is Little Big Planet on source, and a must own for anybody on steam just because it can really apply to anybody when you tweak it a bit, if you've just got steam (or had it for a while) this is the best place to start, plus its on sale every other week now.

94400,Nidhogg,"Entertaining, but the game desperately needs additional features and some bug fixing before I could ever recommend it, or play for more than the odd rare match. Online multiplayer is incredibly laggy, there is no option for local lan play which I see as a huge omission, there is no way of directly choosing to play with a friend so you can't arrange to play people, and the menus need better mouse support or a different UI entirely.  But, the gameplay is there, and that's the biggest hurdle. The aesthetic is solid, the gamemodes are varied and interesting, it's got most of what it needs to be a good multiplayer game between friends. It could be lots of fun, if they could make it so you could actually play with those friends without dealing with 20 rounds of matchmaking roulette to get paired and a ruberbanding stuttery mess when you finally play. It's just pretty hard to actually enjoy the game. I hope for future updates, but I'm not holding my breath.",-1,0
8870,BioShock Infinite,"There are many fantastic things to say about Bioshock Infinite, so much so that one must contain oneself from blurting them out in an incomprehensible mess of words, diction and punctuation. This is the kinda game you can not just play once, there is too much detail in the artwork, sound and hidden meanings to filter through the second time around. I’m not sure how others felt, but I was so overtaken by this game that my usual blinders were not necessary to keep me captivated. It is a fun, adventurous, and dark experience that one shouldn’t miss out on. The only issue for fans of the original Bioshock and Bioshock 2 is that a lot of the horror aspect is dialed down until one reaches the DLCs. There are only a few jump scares, but plenty of incredible haunting fight scenes, from the cries of pain and agony from the Handyman (btw, i don’t know ANYONE who didn’t have some kind of reaction to their pain) to the memorable and spine tingling screeches of the Songbird. Playing as Booker DeWitt was highly enjoyable even with what some people call an extremely surprising ending",1,0

9900,Star Trek Online,"As a player of some previous Star Trek titles (among them Star Trek Voyager: Hazard Team and Star Trek: Starfleet Command Orion Pirates) I was relieved to see this finally come out as a free to play (mostly) game.  To be honest.... It's a good ST combat sim SHIP-wise.... It was reminiscent of STSFC: Orion Pirates, but with a 3D environment, and changeable ship components.... Which is pretty damn cool.  The downfall to this game is the somewhat clunky environments otherwise... like ship interiors (which are massive... Hallways feel more like gymnasiums) and the combat mechanics... It works somewhat like KOTOR, but not as well. You constantly beat down a barrage of enemies that are all the same, and just clustered to get in the way of your objective... And the missions are always linear...  In the series, ship captains are always making life/death decisions, finding diplomatic ways to resolve things, solving puzzles and trying to keep their crew alive in the face of danger. In the MMO, you are forced to either follow the ONE path, with no decisions on your part, or shoot all the enemies in the area to death before they do the same to you. No choice in the matter.  Regardless, the ship customization (name whatever you want, even) and having that customization stick, and be displayed... As well as the tedious but flexible system that allows you to earn in-game currency and use it to acquire things without breaking your wallet is pretty awesome. For the customization of characters and ships, as well as the ability to engage in good ship to ship combat (for the most part), I'd give this game a good rating.  ...I'll just be staying off-planet for battles as much as I can.  7/10 for this one. I always wanted my own starship, and this allows for it for the most part. And it is fun to have your friend join you and captain the 'USS Ragemongrel'",1,0

When Steam's Summer Sale first began, the base game of GTA V was on sale for $30, but it was only at that price for roughly 10-20 minutes. Instead of keeping it at that price, they decided they could con buyers by raising the base game's price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale, which, as countless others have stated, is shady business.

Olly Moss and the Campo art crew are absolute gods of what they have created visually and Chris Remo has created a soundtrack that makes you want to look out a window and think about life.

201490,Airline Tycoon 2,"I have nearly 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews.  One Hour Reviews - Game 5 Airline Tycoon 2 Purchase Date: 9/11/2014  Like a number of games in my Steam library, I came across Airline Tycoon 2 as part of a Humble Bundle. I really like Humble Bundle because not only do I get to donate to a good cause, but sometimes in that bundle I'll come across a really good game that I never would have bought otherwise.  Sadly, Airline Tycoon 2 is not one of those games.  Right off the bat the game scored a negative when I realized I'd have to login to play this game. Given that this is a completely single player game with no internet component whatsoever, I really don't see the point in forcing me to login. The only thing that kept this from being more annoying is apparently I've played some other game from Kalypso, so it remembered my login from that. So at least I didn't have to make another account.  Airline Tycoon 2 tries to inject some humor by presenting you with various cariactures of people like Albert Einstein, who is exactly the person that comes to mind when I need an airline mechanic. You know, cause he's smart. This is the kind of humor you get to look forward to in Airline Tycoon 2.  I played through the tutorial, which does a decent enough job of introducing you to the game concepts. It sent me around the airport to talk to various people, so I could meet all of the goofy characters the game has to offer. It doesn't sound so bad when I say it, but eventually you get tired of running around the airport to visit the mechanic or go to the personnel office to hire a pilot, or hightail it back to your office to plan an airline route.  Imagine playing a city builder except every time you wanted to build a new building, you had to run over to the mayors office and talk to a caricature of the Godfather so you could tell him you want to zone a new block of houses.  So once I talk to Albert Einstein to get my plane decked out, and talk to someone else to get my pilot and crew hired, and someone else to actually tell my crew which plane they are working on, after all that then I can find the manager, so I can rent a route to fly my plane on. They should have put out a version of this game for the Wii that is compatible with the Wii Fit balance board.   After all that, I can head back to my office to plan my flights for the week. It's a bit like setting up meetings in outlook where each route takes up a chunk of time for the day, so the idea is you slot in as many round trips as you can, with some occasional maintenance inbetween flights. You can also set the ticket price on your flights. As the day progresses you can check on your flights and get statistics on things like how satisfied your passengers were and how much money your flight made.  The tutorial did fine at showing me around and introducing me to people I'd rather not talk to, but it doesn't really explain much about the actual strategy in the game. For instance, there are a ton of different planes you can buy, and lots of ways to tailor how the plane looks, both exterior and interior. But I have no idea if it's purely cosmetic or if these choices somehow impact customer satisfaction.  That's really where I ended up at the end of my first hour, wondering how and if my choices affected anything. In the end, I realized that there's really only one choice that matters, and that is the choice not to play this anymore.  Overall Recommendation: Pass",-1,1

When I tried to load it up a week ago, it didn't work. Was a little dissappointed and thought it was time to move on and then it popped up on my front page yesterday. I didn't hesitate. The base game and both expansions are here and there are at least 150 single player missions and more units than you can possibly imagine. Makes for very large scale battles, especially if you are playing on one of the metal maps. The graphics are obviousley lacking and the game isn't as revelutionary as it was then, but this game has great meaning for me and changed the way I viewed gaming. It was the first game that got me really excited and it changed the way games were made. I remember Chris Taylor saying he wanted to go straight to TA2, but they wanted to make TA:Kingdoms, which was a game I enjoyed, but not even close to as much as TA. And because they didn't go straight to TA2, well, the rest is history. TA:K didn't do so well and the company eventually went under with no sequel ever done. The ownership has changed many times over (last I heard a company in Japan had it and wouldn't part with it) and a sequel does not seem to ever be coming which is a tragedy. It is probably one of the reasons this game is as iconic and beloved as it still is today. After loading up the game last night, I coudn't beleive that 2 hours had passed so quickly. Still love and cherish this game.  Still loving this game and just played it for the 20th year in a row.",1,0

209000,Batman™: Arkham Origins,"I like it. People complain about it trying to knock off Arkham City, but Origins is kind of its own thing. It was made by a developer that could not be compared to Rocksteady, but that doesn't mean there wasn't a ton of effort put into it. The city is very polished, and thoughtfully created, and all of the character models were made from scratch. It looks incredible. Again, people like to complain that most of the resources were taken from the previous two games, but the same is true for Arkham City. A keen eye will notice reused animations and skins on more than one occasion, whereas Origins simply blends what made the first two games awesome. It does, at times, feel like Batman: Lite Version, but it still works really well. If you're a fan of the series, check it out. If not, go play Arkham Asylum again. It's a better intro.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"Terraria is a 2D Adventure game packed with action and possibilities to create amazing things. This game used to be seen as a Minecraft copy but it is no longer seen this way since it goes further into combat gameplay than Minecraft ever did. This game has everything you'd want if what you want is action packed combat, adventure, survival, creative possibilities everywhere, and fishing, of course. There's no way you won't like this game if you look deeper into it. Don't get fooled by the dullness at the start of this game, it gets a million times better once you get to 'hardmode'. Oh, and you WILL need 'Guide' or however he get's called (random name generators for every NPC), so don't kill him.

71340,Sonic Generations,"Sonic Generations is a game that tries to please both fans of the classic Sonic, and fans of the modern Sonic. Each stage has two acts, one act for classic Sonic, and one for modern Sonic. After three stages, you have to complete 3 challenges that take place on those three stages you just finished. Each challenge you finish, unlocks a key. When you collect three keys, you go up to the boss door, and it becomes unlocked so you can fight it. In total, the game has nine stages, and four boss fights. The game's story can be completed in 5-6 hours, but I found myself going back to certain stages and replaying them, because I enjoyed them so much. The game's story isn't that great, but most Sonic games aren't known for their great story.   The gameplay is very well done and fun. You can purchase skills and customize your skill sets. The only issue I really had with the gameplay was forgetting that I didn't have a homing attack when I played as classic Sonic, though that is a personal problem. The game's music is fantastic. The graphics are also very well done and beautiful, for the most part. I had a couple of glitches happen during gameplay, but nothing major. The game runs pretty smoothly, but it had a couple little hiccups while playing (could just be my PC). The only thing about this game that I didn't really enjoy, was the last boss. It wasn't really difficult, just annoying. One of my favorite parts of the game, were the rival battles. There are only 3 in the game, but I really enjoyed them. In the end, I'd say this is one of the best modern Sonic games released to date. I give it an 8/10.",1,0

242860,Verdun,"Verdun in my own opinion is a good game. It's not a great game and it won't win awards any time soon.   Basically it's an FPS set in WW1...Yes, WW1 and the game does a really good job when making the atmosphere for WW1, the guns feel nice and realistic alongside the realistic(ish) gameplay. I say it like that because if it was realistic, it would be so much harder. Which brings up difficulty. Off the bat, when you play, without knowing what to do even from a horrible tutorial...you're going to die. A lot. It's like Red Orchestra 2 with the realistic sense and difficulty, when you get shot with a rifle and one bullet. You're dead, simple as. Not in trenches and out in the open? Dead. Wrong place? Dead. Can you shoot the person before someone shoots you?   Even with all the difficulty, I really enjoying playing this game because it is fun when playing in WW1, you feel like there's impact and cause to play it. It's not CoD or Battlefield, they're streamlined. This game isn't, you have to learn as you play from the terrain, weapons and tactics. When you chat to strangers in a squad, you can sometimes have a good team and funny moments like I did. But there are lots who don't communicate. It's best played with friends.   The game looks good, there some poor textures with for the most part, you'll need a decent PC to run it.  However, there are bad points to the game. First off, when you read the tips when the game loads. They say if you like the game, give them a good rating and review. That is horrible and really bad, they should not say that in their game. And They sound like they won't take criticism well.   The progression system is awful, when you play as a class you think you'd get the weapon that's dedicated for that role. But no, you may not get an LMG but a rifle instead. In still have no idea how the progression system works or if I'm doing anything at all besides levelling up. But when inspecting the screens on the right when you view, theres a lock symbol and when I moused over it, it has an unlocked symbol so I clikced it and it was avaliable to me. So the stars you collect are points to unlock new things.   And I think the map designs are good but there ones that are just plain awful. In my opinion, if there's too much open area for the advancing team they get to have generous positions to shoot the defenders without problems because they have more cover and bushes, grass, trees, trenches hide them and to the people who aren't good at the game are hopeless.  Sorry for being so long but it is a good game with many improvements to be made, I'd like to say it's still in development eternally. At this moment, I highly recommend you wait for a sale on this thing. It's not worth the full price.",1,0

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"The best multiplayer I've ever played. It might not appear at first glance, but there's so much skill to it. At the same time though, there's no slow boring dull learning curve, the fun starts right from the word go even if you're not very good at it. Expect to die a lot at first, but just use a big weapon like the polehammer and charge around swinging it like a nutter (try to avoid your teammates though) and you'll notch up a good few kills. Especially if you stick to the beginner servers (which restricts eligible users based on experience). And as you progress, you lear new tricks and techniques all the time, constantly improving how you outwit and outmaneuvre apponents. It started out a little unrefined, but they've ironed out most of the bugs now and it's a solid reliable game. The graphics and sound are really immersive.  Advice for new players: I'd recommend AVOIDing Man at Arms and Archer at first. Fun to play with once you're used to the game, but they can be difficult and frustrating classes. Stick to the Knight and Vanguard in your early stages, which are heavily armoured and use high damage weapons. Once you're good with them, then try experimenting with MaA/archer.",1,0

283330,Desert Thunder,"In Desert Thunder you control an experimental tank and are asked to single-handedly liberate a country from a terrorist threat: you do so by basically blowing up everything as you move through levels. The result is sadly a very arcadey game with dull gameplay, awkward controls and little variety.   PROS:   -can be mildly fun for the first minutes  -considering its age the game had a decent amount of destructible objects  -shells have bullet drop  -the voice acting isn't too bad   CONS:   -extremely repetitive gameplay gets dull fast  -forgettable soundtrack  -barebones, cliched story  -the tank controls awkwardly  -problematic camera  -poor AI  -meager enemy variety  -quite a bit of clipping    http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=563237800   Desert Thunder is a one-trick pony with a pretty lousy trick: it asks you to stay interested for the two hours it takes to beat it by simply throwing wave after wave of enemies and hoping you'll be happy with all the resulting explosions. Don't expect any tactics, deep gameplay or interesting missions: what you see in the first minutes is all you get: now, this'd be good for some if the gameplay was at least decent but sadly it has a plethora of problems.  For starters the tank controls very badly as it slides around, has no traction, an huge turning circle and will stop abruptly if you hit a small slope or a wooden sign: its turret also can't rotate 360 degrees making it difficult to properly engage enemies behind you. The awkward controls are paired with sections where you need to zigzag between mines or ostacles (sometimes under fire) and this gets annoying fast. The camera also moves jerkily whenever you hit something of a different height and this can get either confusing or downright nausea inducing.  Pair the aforementioned problems with a lack of enemy variety- all sporting a braindead AI- and extremely repetitive missions and you'll easily see how Desert Thunder is a dull, forgettable experience that you can safely skip.",-1,1
258890,Type:Rider,"Short platforming game based on an interesting concept with beautiful level designs. Just one downside: the controls are absolute BALLS... literally. You control a colon (aka ':') in the game, represented as two rolling balls, but they simply don't move or respond quite the way you want them to. This only becomes frustrating at the later stages when crisp platforming is required, but when the rage hits you, you'll be left wondering how a game about FONTS could make you so angry. There's no penalty for mistakes, but still... it's almost enough to say the brief and otherwise enjoyable experience isn't worth putting up with the sluggish handling.",1,0

238090,Sniper Elite 3,"I recommend this game, but not at full price. I got it for 70% discount, which I think is probably about right... but for a full $49.99, I'd say 'Meh'. Mainly because it's too short for a full-priced game, with only 8 single player missions. Big ones, but still...  I wasn't interested in multi-play, as there are better games for that.  Graphically fantastic. Great audio. Good maps. Nice bullet mechanics (get a kill on a riccochet? Yes please!) and AI who are stupid, but not *too* stupid, and you've got a decent game which is a lot of fun.  Run-and-gun will get you killed quickly - the machineguns are pretty weak. The Welrod silenced pistol is deadly at close-range, but the rifle is your primary, and even at close range is the weapon of choice if you're not too worried about nearby AI hearing you.  I never played the earlier Sniper Elite games so I can't compare - but I enjoyed this one thoroughly.  --- Update ---  I finished this in 23hrs, and a good chunk of that involved sitting at a menu while I went and did something else. Fun game - but too short and the DLC missions are a bit expensive for what they are. I still recommend this, but wait for it to go on special.",1,0

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"First off to be honest I am not entirely sure why it took me so long to write this review, but here it goes.   This game is damn amazing I have a LOT of hours on it and play both ranked and casual all the time. I know its easy to get bored with most games after a while, but to be honest I have no idea what makes this game so fun everytime I play it, the many operator choices are fantastic each operator unique in their own way, (Hail Chank), each of these operators can change the outcome of matches. Especially Echo the newest defender to the siege family, he is great for slowing the push of the attackers and fantastic for giving callouts to the team. The maps while I did not like the first 3 DLC maps the newest Skyscraper I am finding that I am having a lot of fun with it. Performance wise this game is greatly optimized, I have encountered zero technical issues and I run the game on high settings with 70-80 FPS.   To sum it up I definitely give this game a 10/10, and Im very excited to see the next year of DLC, (Praying they bring Israeli Operators as the first DLC for Season Pass 2).  Other than that I definitely reccommend you get this game if you are looking to buy a tactical, team based, realistic shooter, and if you do and need help add me and I'll be down to show you the ropes or if you are just looking for a squad, I have a lot of people that are always looking for 5 in ranked.

Anyone arguing otherwsie just needs to look at the fact Blood and Burning (blood and fire/smoke) effects are not included in the game and you have to buy them seperatly. I'd avoid this game and wait and see if they do the same with the upcoming warhammer game, at least that will have a fresh feel to it. Be wary about pre-purcahse though both the last games had significant game breaking bugs on release, and with Rome 2 it took them 9 motnhs to fix most the problems.

I still believe this is a great game, an awesome game, a supreme blast and loads of fun...  BUT: Game went from owerwhelmingly positive to very positive, and for me too.  The best is for me the wasteland, the scenario is utterly inspiring and really really cool.  There IS one thing that lowered my opinion quite a lot: the survival aspect.   How cool it would have been if the initial pressure of surviving remained a bit longer. Instead, you level up without even noticing nor wanting it, and your character is MAXed a lot earlier than the middle of the game.   I thought several hours ago in the game that a realistic difficulty, a 'Fallout: New Vegas Hardcore Difficulty' was missing in this game. Now I am absolutely convinced this lack is a flaw.  What if all that scrap scrap everywhere scrap would have been components instead,  or the lack of water and oil was a bit more preminent, more crucial?  What was good, remains good:  The relics (THIS is the best for me: to see pictures and words of the vanished world we still live in, for now). I look behind every stone in the desert for those.  The storms!  THAT is what I'd like the game to be: a struggle for survival more than a normal action movie that it is.  A bit more of madness: that's what this (almost a) masterpiece lacks.  More Mad and less Max.  On the other hand, once you own the game USE the screenshot editor, because it adds a solid +50% of fun to the game.",1,1
423230,Furi,"I've followed this game since the announcement and was initially drawn in by Carpenter Brut's involvement, so hype was high from the start. Then unexpectedly getting to play the game at Pax East and chat with dev Emeric Thoa further increased my excitement.  Actually playing the game has completely smashed my expectations. This game is the most hard driving, heart pounding, badass feeling game with the best soundtrack since Hotline Miami. I'm not typically good at bullet hell games but with by learning how the stranger moves and what his abilities are, anyone can get good at the game, but it takes a while to master. The battles are quite a challenge, but like the controls once you learn the enemy you're fighting, you can deal some serious blows in a badass manner.  The lulls between matches work wonderfully for both storytelling and cooldown. My one gripe is with the controls during those lulls but pressing A has you automove and lets you really take in these beatiful environments and soundtrack they have created.

107410,Arma 3,Arma 3 is The perfect game if you're looking for a military simulation.  -Good Points: There is a lot of multiplayer server. Some server can host until 200 people. The Eden Editor allows you to create your own misssion and to publish it in the Steam Workshop. You have a lot of military and civilian vehicle/weapon/stuff. The graphics are pretty good. There is tons of mods and content.  -Bad Points: Not very optimised. The AI could be better. Sadly you can find bug/glitches.,1,1

342200,MechWarrior Online,"Its a good game. Feels like a slowed down version of Armored core with a harder lock on system.   That said, this game feels more achin to chess then to Armored Core. You will die from the pawns as a queen, knight, rook whatever, if you are in the wrong spot. Through trial and error or success you'll learn where risky places are and where safe ones are and how to pander to bad situations or simply to know when you've been outclassed. You WILL be outclassed, some people are simply better. Good news is, its not about how quickly you can sight cross hairs on someones head from 100 meters (although you if you get good at that in this game you will wreck) its about awareness and team cohesion.  The mechs DO look amazing, all the hype about the models is real. They look amazing.   THe maps are.... interesting. They range from super long range, to super short range, but there is no way to say whether as a short range mech, you get the map you want. I feel that not all the maps have somewhere where every play style shines. I look to TF2 for map design, and feel they did very well. There are tight corners, little nooks, long corridors, hoppable outcrops and cover smattering everywhere; all things, that each seperate class looks for to allow them an advantage. Not quite so in this. Pretty much it plays similarly to real life. Life occasionally hands you lemons and you need to deal with it.  THe rewards system i would like to see buffed, but as it is, being a heavy brawly mech is the best way to get C-bills *in game currency*  It is NOT pay to win. Eventually, everything that you can pay for with $$$ you can also pay for with C-bills. *with some exceptions* eg. hero mechs. (which don't break the game, just another variant of existing mechs)  I recommend this game. Its a solid title that will scratch the mech-customization-fps itch some people may have. Its not the best, but as far as mech games on a PC goes, its brilliant.",1,0

222880,Insurgency,"Insurgency is a modern tactical first person shooter that employs the use of hyper-realism and tactical gameplay. If you are looking for a one man army run and gun shooter you are looking in the WRONG PLACE, if you are looking for a game in which unless you communicate and play effectively AS A TEAM, then you are in the RIGHT place. Play as a team often means a win, and not doing so, almost always means failure. Even a SNIPER has to communicate here as he often spots enemies from afar. If you LOVE teamplay oriented gameplay (as I do). PICK THIS GAME UP! You will not regret it.",1,0

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"Evolve is a very solid game from the same developer that did Left 4 Dead. It keeps the same multiplayer co-op 'story driven' feel as L4D. Playing as the hunters requires a good amount of coordination or luck to effectively take down monsters while playing as a monster can be very rewarding when you beat down 4 hunters in an onlsaught of rock throws, lightning or many other special ablities. The game offers solo, multiplayer 4 vs bot monster (the bots are actually competent and can wreck face), or 4 players vs 1 player. Controls are handled very well in how the monsters or hunters move and operate, the only complaint I have is at times trying to climb something either hunter or monster can be hit or miss especially when depleted of stamina or jet pack fuel leaving you trapped in corners trying to avoid the enemy. Graphics look great as its built using the CryEngine so cranking up your settings can be very visually rewarding. Sounds are definitely great also ranging from the distance thumps of the monster, rushing water, birds, gun blasts, and etc. The most common complaint I've seen on the reviews have been from the price or DLC. The only one that applies to the actual review of the game is the DLC which is NOT day 1 DLC or hidden until release, they have specific dates further down the line which include other hunters, monsters and etc. If a player doesn't want to buy skins...which yes you have to pay for (they do run a business and to run a business you need someone to pay for your product even if people think its 'mundane'). All in all I've been having a great experience either with friends or randoms, and if you are on the fence about this game check out review from gaming sites and I dont remember seeing anything below an 8. I also purchased the Master Race Edition as I felt for the game, dlc and other included stuff it would be welll worth it as I previously enjoyed the developer's games and you know this is going to be a heavly modded game just like L4D! All in all I would give this game a 9/10 with the faults being minor control 'errors' and woutd like to see more varied environments such as urban, deserts, plains, snow areas (does have small areas with snow). See you in the forest and Happy Hunting!",1,1
302510,Ryse: Son of Rome,"Are you not entertained? As long as you're not paying full price, you will be!  This is a quick, yet fun romp through the brutal and bloody world of a master melee combatant in the form of a roman legionary. Very impressive on the graphical front despite its age, the gameplay is also solid and - dare I say the cliche - deceptively simple.  While the game does have quite a bit of allowance (I completed it on the normal difficulty setting in 5 hours), it really shines when you're playing it well. It has the seemingly now common fighting mechanic that you see across the Batman games and Sleeping Dogs, where timing matters quite a bit and things play out like a very hectic and bloody Simon Says. The name of the game is executions. Being able to switch out execution bonuses on the fly and reading your opponents is what makes this eye candy shine.  Five hours might make you think 'What is this crap!?!' - but you'd be wrong. CoD4: MW was over in the same amount of time, and in both these games the time is just enough to get the message done. The fighting is intense, rarely lets up, and gives you enough freedom that a second playthrough for myself is already on the horizon. I have yet to play multiplayer, but if it's any good as the single player at the visceral level, then I can't wait!  About the only negative I can give is that the ending... oh... I can figure why it was done the way it was done, but why? I hope this is not common thing that goes on.   8/10 - Did they really have to do that in the ending? Sure, it worked cinematically, but... - There's no way to put this, but... Summer's boobs.",1,0
225080,Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons,"The story is well told and the imagery is striking. Starbreeze should be commended on what they have tried to do to merge gameplay with narrative, especially in its closing moments.

I struggled with the ambidextrous controls, pushing on only to see the story through to its (admittedly excellent) conclusion.",-1,0

288060,Whispering Willows,"Whispering Willows is a sidescrolling adventure game, driven by its story and atmosphere, about a haunted mansion and the surrounding grounds. It's charming, and can pull you in for a little while, but it's hampered by some cumbersome situations and rudimentary elements. I beat it in five hours, while taking my time, and had a decent amount of fun despite the flaws. There are a few last achievements you can hunt down when you're done, but no real replayability.  The game has very attractive graphics, with nice lighting and glow effects. The ghosts you meet have a cartoony style, but are still depicted with various fatal injuries that add some distinction to each one. I'm not a fan of the cutscene artwork, as it looks a lot more crude and clumsy than the game itself.  The sound is nice as well. Subtle music and eerie ambient noises give each indoor and outdoor location its own feel. Invisible creatures, both helpful and harmful, are signaled by the noise of your character's amulet, or of their own mysterious movements.  The game is played by exploring each area of the mansion. This is a mostly linear experience: talking to ghosts, unlocking doors and collecting necessary items along with documents that gradually tell the game's story. Experiencing new environments and reading the story are really the high points of the game, but toward the end, many of the rooms are bleakly similar to each other, the abritrary size and layout of the mansion leading to some slow backtracking. If you manage to miss something, you'll be plodding around for a few minutes, trying to figure it out, and the feeling of reward when you get it right isn't as satisfying as in some more elegantly built games.  Puzzles are often solved by assuming a spirit form which can pass through openings in walls and ceilings, and manipulate objects like switches or keys. There are a few moments of novelty to this, but compared to some games about changing forms or manipulating your environment, Whispering Willows uses it in a fairly simple and straightforward way. The final scenarios of the game remind me of the game Ghost Trick, but Whispering Willows can't really compare to something like that.  The story is fairly interesting, largely delivered through notes that you pick up. It's fairly easy to find them all, so you probably won't miss out on any details. The story falters a bit near the end, in my opinion, by trying to be a bit more epic than it is, but it reveals some final truths and then wraps itself up without dragging on too long.  In the end, parts of the game shine more than others, but it still all comes together to a decent experience. It can feel slow or annoying in some areas, but I've played worse. If the ghostly atmosphere, solving a few puzzles, and collecting and reading notes and letters to piece the story together sounds fun, you might have a good time with this game; otherwise, I would steer far away from it. Either way, I would wait for a sale. This isn't a game so amazing you just have to play it right now, and $15 is a lot for a short one like this.",1,1
20920,The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,"If your PC cannot reach the extremely high system requirements of Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt but you want to play something of that sort, this game is the one. It offers great combat, haunting storyline, great RPG elements etc. As it is always better to have background information on interesting storylines like the Witcher universe, this game will also show you how things came to be in the third game. Featuring basic info and the roots of the Wild Hunt, Witchers, the Witch Hunt, Yennefer and Geralt in depth and so much more that will draw you even deeper into the series. It would be at least a 7.5/10",1,0
280160,Aragami,"Aragami is pretty much a stealth only game, since once you have been seen, it is hard (but not completely impossible) to complete the area you are in. Enemies that have seen you will alert others making it harder to surprise them. But that kinda makes it appealing, since it is that stealth the game is all about. There is no HUD, all the meters are on the character, which sometimes makes for not such great visibility of them, but most of the time it just helps the whole experience.  There are a few bugs in multiplayer (like loosing connection and having to start the chapter over again), but nonetheless multiplayer is where the fun really begins. And nothing compares to the feeling of your first simulkill, supressing the urge to high-five your partner in crime. The levels are spacious enough to loose your comrade out of sight, with a little icon helping to regroup if needed. There is plenty of things to do for two players in the maps, and plenty of enemies to be avoided or executed.  The two play-styles, peaceful and murderous, both exist, with peaceful often being the easier route (and also the faster). In my opinion though, killing all enemies is way more fun, and thankfully - to this date - the game does not punish you for doing so. The story is nothing really spectacular or new, but dramatic and fetching nonetheless.  To put it in a nutshell, Aragami is what is to be expected at the price, and more. There are some bugs, especially in multiplayer and the HUD sometimes not being clearly visible due to the fact that it is on the clothing of the main character, and some features like collapsing platforms, that only work in singleplayer, but it is Indie, and judging by the changelogs, always improved on. I definitely recommend buying it, cause it is a heck of a lot of fun, and I recommend playing it with a friend.",1,0

227940,Heroes & Generals,"This is what could be an astoundingly fun game.  However, from what I have played in it so far it feels like one of those you get what you pay for deals and if you pay zero and think you can play for free forever forget it you're wrong because you won't get very far whatsoever! You'll literally get hammered into the ground and won't ever get very far other than the regular team based matches.  It's got a cool mode that allows you to fight for and capture territories and an app to track and take part if offline sorta.  But the thing is, you have to level up to get there otherwise you're stuck doing team vs team random maps only and by the time you do level up it really messes with you and doesn't seem to count any of the time and effort you put into it to get to that point even after earning free gold and upgrades and everything in between including the kitchen sink!  Also, I really fail to understand why in the world these games rarely ever put destruction physics in them in some way! Not having that in some minimal shape or form is beyond me and pretty unrealistic and a huge game turn-off.   I've tried to get ahead in this game several times on several different occasions with tons of kills and same problem every single time so forget it, i'm done with this one, and i'll stick to a paid game I know and love called ' Battlefield ' much better in the long run anyway if you're gonna invest in any game.

341150,Age of Fear 2: The Chaos Lord GOLD,"I'm going to start with the bad because all of the following are bad enough that you should know before going in. First off, the game is clunky and doesn't look great. The story, while well-written, is a wall of text and the tutorial is barely there causing me some early confusion (I didn't realize my soldiers had the Beserk trait and automatically spend their action to attack nearby enemies). Finally, the game is old-school random that can be frustrating (An early battle has 2 enemy groups that should weaken one another before facing you. But due to bad luck one steamrolled the other and then crush me.)   But despite the complaints I am having alot fun. The hex-less battles create some really cool tactical thinking. Positioning matters both to protect your troops and leave room for them to manuever past one another. The AI can be a jerk because it will circle around and target your weak troops if possible. This becomes more important because surviving troops can gain levels and you'll want to keep everyone alive.    If you can get past the flaws, there's a really good game here.",1,1

203160,Tomb Raider,"A fantastic reawakening of the Tomb Raider franchise. Experience the blood, sweat, and tears that made Lara into Croft. It's not glitchy insane difficult like the early titles of barely missed jumps and crosshair-less shooting either. The impressive auto-save everytime you find something (and reload in a safe zone) is a rage-quit saver as well. Mechanics are more flexible with greater parkour and tools to explore what seems like ridiculously dangerous terrains lol. Not the most difficult title and only some puzzles will stump you, but the gameplay and graphics are incredibly fufilling with a lot of side quests and hidden secrets. Story is pretty solid, but it's the gameplay and graphics that will top the experience. Only real gripe are the ridiculous surprise QTEs that WILL kill your ♥♥♥. They reveal other universes where Lara actually died, by stupid stuff, cause it's somehow funny. But thankfully the quicksave reloads right before the QTEs (else things break like in the 90s).",1,0
203160,Tomb Raider,Great reboot of a legendary series where we witness Lara's development from a shy student explorer to the tough hero we knew for years.

The Singleplayer part of this game is one of the better storylines I have played in my life and I've enjoyed it during multiple playthroughs.

346560,Hero of the Kingdom II,"If you like the first game, you'll most likely enjoy this one too. But honestly, Hero of the Kingdom II isn't nearly as good as its prequel. Uninspired story, too non-linear, almost no exploration (except for optional dungeons) and lots of grinding. I had fun, but I can only recommend it for people who loved the prequel and want more of it.",-1,0
493340,Planet Coaster,"This is the true rollercoaster tycoon 4 it is everything that a theme park builder should be. It has great creativity with the steam workshop and all the in game tools available. Planet Coaster can be played as a scenery creator or as a rollercoaster creator either way this is great but there is one downside that i have fount so far the terrain paint tool will only let you paint the terrain certain colours depending on the park that you are in, so if you cant paint the terrain a red rock colour in a tropical park meaning that you will not be able to create a 'western' theme in the tropical park. But with that said it is still a brilliant game with lots of creative possibilities.",1,0

Very appropriate since you really need to focus on the story at hand. Without spoiling too much I am so glad developers are making games like this and letting people know this is a natural process and you can come through it. Brilliant game and I can't say enough good things about it.",1,0

They've successfully ported with and maybe even better graphics than the original ones of the PS3 version and the core mechanics intact. Downside though is the lack of soft engine, several maps and, well, it's a port of the PS3 version and not the PS4 and no online play. Although, the online play will be added in a patch later on. Other than that it's actually pretty great and runs smoothly at 60 fps and another good addition of what used to be console only franchise for the PC.",1,0

In terms of the Steam version in particular, it's a lot smoother than the browser because no Unity to crash.

206420,Saints Row IV,"The low violence version available in Australia is incompatable with the international version of this game making the amount of people you can play multiplayer games with somewhat limited. And it was for this reason alone that I do not reccomend this game. If you are outside of Australia or you can legally obtain a ROW version then by all means get this game.  Gameplay wise it has a virtually identical map and graphics engine to SR3 , The addition of superpowers also make the inclusion of fully custimizable and drivable cars somewhat redundant. The novelty value of superpowers is kind of fun for a while but it got old fast and I found myself going back and playing SR3 after I was done with this.",-1,1

4560,Company of Heroes - Legacy Edition,"Company of Heroes is a real-time strategy game from THQ and now published by SEGA. Company of Heroes takes place in 1944, Europe, when and after the Allies launch the Operation Overlord.  Company of Heroes has good gameplay. You build your base camp and fortify it before assaulting the enemy base camp and destroy it. Infantry unit can take cover on walls, fence or garrison themselves in houses or any other buildings that garrisonable. Unlike many other RTS game, infantry in Company of Heroes is a force to be reckoned with. They can be upgraded with better weapons or even be equiped with anti-tank weapons to engage armored vehicles. Vehicles and tanks also has unique damage system. Their engine can be blown off, immobilizing them. When vehicle unit finally destroyed, they can be 'out of control' that they will hit something and explode. Each faction has 3 unique command tree with each command tree has its own special ability.  Graphics of Company of Heroes is beautiful on its age. Explosion effect, skies, muzzle flash and weapon tracers are amazing. Animation are even more realistic as it can be. Infantry will act based on the battlefield situation and the state of the infantry, like when they are pinned down or retreating. Smoke and fire effect is also great.  Performance of Company of Heroes is quite bad. Most of the time you will run the game just fine, but sometimes you will encounter sudden stutters or even lags even on advanced computers. The engine still need to be optimized. AI performance still quite good regarding this, and will give challenge on harder difficulty.  Overall, Company of Heroes is amazing real-time strategy game with advanced graphics and decent style of gameplay. With a bit more optimization, the game will be even more amazing. I recommend this.  Rating 8/10",1,0

550,Left 4 Dead 2,THIS GAME COMBINES BOTH L4D AND L4D2 but let's get real. Although this game is 6 years old it is still overrated but the reason why it is overrated is not such a bad thing this is one game for all of those zombie hunters to go kick some zombie ♥♥♥ but when you start lagging it is a huge problem since this game POURS zomibies on you left and right. This can help you and destroy you since there are achievements and trading cards for this game. The thing I love about this game is that it is very fast paced and there is a vast varity of weapons there are many game modes there is a steam workshop for this game to get community made mods and it is well optimised. My score for this game is an 8.5/10 -Pixel The Skunk,1,0

11190,Sherlock Holmes versus Jack the Ripper,"WARNING NVIDIA USERS: The game might get stuck on the first loading screen the first time you start playing the game. If this happens, check the forum for fix. Worked for me.   Very good game for it's time and on level with the rest of the good part of this series. The voice actors and music are the same as in previous games; decent to good, nothing terrible in voice acting but a few random volume/quality changed from sentence to sentence some times.  The story follows Sherlock Holmes as he investigates the brutal murders of some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in Whatechapel, London. The game is slightly less gory and bloody than other games in the series, mostly because the murder victms you inspect are drawings and dolls, and not 3d-models, which gives a completely different feel; but then again you may not want to see models of women with their guts and organs ripped out and face cut open, so a pretty good design choice. Still not a game safe for children.   The game visits both new places and a few places known from other game in the series. The puzzles still give no clues about how they are to be solved, which can be frustrating. There is no failure state in this game, so no real reason to save often (thought there is no autosave, so do save if you plan to closing the game), and the game never crashed for me.  The game does not rely as heavily on document-reading as the previous ones and there's no quiz or direct minor questions asked to chekc if you're paying attention. You may have to read up to solve a few of the puzzles though.",1,0
251870,Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~,A great way to learn more about Tokyo!  Gameplay: This game has some amazing art and a story that lets you chose between two beautiful girls. During the game you get to chose to which location of Tokyo you want to go and learn a lot about that location. Because of this you get to know allot about the different zones of Tokyo and what they have to offer. It also gives you a link to google maps where you can see the location where you are in the game. What is also very useful is that you get to learn a few facts about traveling by train in japan.  The Story: The game has a enjoyable story (not very long but quite eventful). It is the protagonists first time in Japan and he gets to stay with two really cute girls! During his time with them he learns a lot about Tokyo and becomes really close with them. But what he learns and with whom he becomes the closets is something you can best discover by playing the game...  A fun visual novel with likeable characters. I truly recommend giving it a shot if you havent already!,1,1

Great weapons and such, Awesome grapics aswell! I'm so glad i played this.   Bad things: It only took me 3 hours to finish, It has multiplayer, But i dont really play that so can't judge. Altough i heard it has a lot of hackers. So only buy it for the single player story imo. It also has a few grapic glitches, such as shadows being a little wierd.. But overall it looks very good!..  I got this game on sale for about 7$, And its really worth the money even with the 3 hours of gameplay only. But yeah, If you get this for single player. I suggest a sale. Its worth about 10$ imo.

You're essentialy killing baddies in every mission, with very little variance. Even the Matrix missions were just two color versions of the 'meat world.'

This game technicaly takes only around 6 min to beat (each level's goal is 60 sec), but you will spend hours on it (depending on your persistence). Me? I'm stubborn. (As I'm writing this review) I have 12 hours on record and just beat all six levels. Was it worth it? Maybe. Tips for beginners: 1. Learn to love the music. It helps you keep time with the game. 2.

238010,Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut,Deus Ex HR could have been on my list of best games ever but it just falls short. The original HR fell short becuse of the boss fights which went aganist the whole logic of the rest of the game while HR DC falls short becuase of preformance issues. I was able to play the original HR without any problems on my laptop while the DC version suffers from a lot of stuttering when the action kics off. It's not a game killer but it's enought to pull me out of the game.   The gamplay is still awesome as is the great story so theres not much change and in the DC version you get the DLC a missing link which was a good story I felt.  This is a good game but like I said a few flaws prevented it from being truely great.,1,0

298360,Immortal Defense,"I purchased the original version of Immortal Defense quite a long time ago, and I'm glad that it has finally made its way to Steam. ID is one of the best Tower Defense style games I have ever played.  On a mechanical level, the towers are not the formulaic set you find in most other games. You know, the 'weak but fast' tower, the 'long range and slow' tower, the 'splash damage' tower, etc. You won't find that here. Each of the towers has vastly different behaviors, making you think more carefully about placement. Behavior can change as you upgrade them, and they can also interact with your cursor as well (which is a weapon in its own right).  The game is also very challenging - experienced Tower Defense players will be tested here. But, the difficulty can be adjusted along the way, so if it's just too hard, you can dial the difficulty down a bit - for the one level you're having trouble with - and come back to it later if you want.  Visually, Immortal Defense is fun. This is an older game but it still looks great. It's somewhere between a dream, a laser light show, and an LSD experience all rolled up into one. The visuals can also be dialed up and down as needed, though, so if it is too much for you, you can get back to a more 'sane' experience. I recommend keeping on the higher side.  The music is great too - it has a delicate, mystical quality that fits very well with the art style.  Generally, tower defense games have at most a token storyline, something that is easy to throw away and ignore. But Immortal Defense delivers here, too - taken as a whole, the story of Immortal Defense gets into some interesting philisophical questions about immortality, good and evil, what is really important, etc. The towers (called Points in the game) come out of the story, and their names and functionality are drawn out of it as well.   It might be a bit too cerebral for a lot of people, but it won't interfere with the gameplay.  For the Steam version of the game, there are new challenges that you can complete for additional bonuses during gameplay. There is also a leaderboard.  Overall, I rate this as a very strong buy for anyone who enjoys the Tower Defense genre and is looking for something a little different. Visuals aside, I put ID on the same level as other TD greats.  Disclosure: Studio Eres provided me with an advance copy of the Steam version for the purposes of play testing and review.",1,0

288930,The Charnel House Trilogy,"First of all, this 'trilogy' isn't really a trilogy. It's a set of three chapters that are themselves the first part in a series. Notice how that title says 'The Charnel House'? Well, there's no Charnel House in this game. Instead, this is about the travel TO Charnel House - some place that is said to appear in the NEXT game. ...so this whole game is some sort of pointless prequel.  It's a prequel about two protagonists: A generic professor, and a generic teen, and their backstories told through completely random scenes that defy all logic, up to the point where the randomness is just made fun of.  ...and this isn't the first time that the creators have done this. That last game from them I played was ALSO about a guy and a girl stuck somewhere, just flashing back to backstory. At least The Charnel House was better animated.  Game darts back and forwards between random symbolic horror and boring teen angst of the worst sort, and there's very little payoff along the way.",-1,0

48220,Might & Magic: Heroes VI,"I've decided to mini-review the M&amp;M Heroes 6 + expansions pack, after finishing the entire campaign series.   Without further ado, gameplay-wise!  Gameplay Strong Points: Fairly Competent AI most of the time. Last series of fixes have reduced exploitability by a fair margin Campaign objectives make sense. Decent series of units, most complement each other. Heroes matter, a lot.  Gameplay weak Points: Migh vs Magic heroes...Magic heroes often end grossly overpowered for campaign play. AI during skirmishes either wins all neutral battles flawlessly, or gets stuck without a fair army. AI coded to do the same series of attacks over and over again. Game still liable to CTD, especially with nvidia graphics cards. AI failmoves, but what game doesn't have that?   Story, Graphics and Misc. Good Points. Campaigns last you quite a few hours each. Dynasty goodies, special side quests and hidden bonusses makes exploring a reward. Maps offer different approaches, lots of goodies and quite a challenge at times.  Bad points. Story and dialogue wise, it's pretty generic. I personally didn't really care for the story much, deeming the theme and way the theme was handled overused. Campaign mission difficulty gaps. Some missions are insanely hard, only to be followed up with a cakewalk, or vice versa. Some missions also require replays because they punish a mistake you made early on a few steps from endgame. Tear of Asha. Cute that it's included, but ends up being overkill on half the maps it's given on. No Random Map Generator, killing the replay value of the skirmish maps very, very much. Item Placement at skirmish maps makes no sense, oftentimes giving you a completed moon disk/tear/full set/epic artifacts/et cetera ad nauseum before even getting past flagging your first mines.   Overall though, it's not as bad as people yell at times and certainly worth a try if you're into the type of game, especially if it goes on sale. The full package, even when lacking a RMG for skirmish + obvious flaws during the playthroughs, still holds a bit of appeal.  If I'd have to grade the game without comparing it to previous games of the series, it'd come out on a 7-(6.75 for those unfamiliar with +s and -'s).  Worth a try if you like the series or the genre, do pass if it's not up your alley.",1,1

Tongue in Cheek sense of humor (and it only gets weirder with the right Perk) is a throwback to the Fallout 2 days, which is fantastic. Add in the thriving Modder community and you've got a recipe for a damn fine game.  Negatives, of course, are the Bugs. Oh lord, the bugs.

The story is one of the best in the Star Wars universe (even if you count the movies and other extended universe materials), the caracters are well writen (the only annoying thing about them is they tend to be mostly good or bad, no inbetween, but we are talking about Star Wars witch is a universe built on those sort of extremes) and the clasic RPG mechanics really work in this game. I strongly recommend this game, if you are into story heavy RPG's, but you have to search the internet for a DLL Vista/win7 fix and you have to download an unoficial community patch to get it to work on newer operating systems (whitch is kind of a hussle).",1,0

337930,Nameless ~The one thing you must recall~,"This game is a romance sim with a wonderful story that keeps you wanting to know what happens next. I have played and watched other people play romance games like this before, but most of them are different in that they have a mechanic where you raise a stat (Like intelligence or beauty) in order to progress with your love interest. Even though I liked these games too, that mechanic felt repetitive and tedious at times, because I just wanted to find out what would happen next in the story. Nameless, however, does not use this mechanic. The game progresses based entirely on your dialogue choices. How you choose to speak and act towards the other characters will affect how the story unfolds.   I have only one real negative critique of the game, which is that it could use a patch to fix the spelling and grammatical errors in the translation. If you are someone who absolutely cannot stand misspellings and typos, then you may not want to pick up the game until those are fixed. However, if you can look past the errors (which probably occurred during translation), then you will find a really great story, which is the main reason why I recommend this game.   The story and characters are very strong. The voice acting is done well, and it gives you a sense of each character's personality. The characters feel three-dimensional, and they are very likeable across the board. I was especially happy that the main character has a real personality and sense of humor, unlike some romance sim main characters, who feel rather flat and colorless. The romantic interests also have very interesting personalities, motivations, and stories of their own, which has kept me wanting to play through until I have seen every piece of the story. I have not played through every path yet. However, the stories and characters in Nameless are so intriguing that I plan to try to get every ending, good and bad. The creators of Nameless have made a game that has a story which is sweet, funny, sad, and even sometimes terrifying, and I heartily recommend it.",1,0

254700,Resident Evil 4,"(TLDR? This review is also available in video format if you scroll down.)  Nine years have passed since Resident Evil 4’s initial release on the GameCube and it still holds up quite well. It’s a massively influential game that helped pioneer the third person shooter genre as well as completely changed the face of survival horror.  You’ll once again fill the shoes of Leon Kennedy as he searches for the President's missing daughter, Ashley, in a remote area of Spain. She’s being held by a mysterious cult, known as the Los Illuminados who are utilizing a mind-controlling parasite called Las Plagas in order to gain power. The village that Leon first comes across is filled with infected townsfolk aptly named Ganado or “herd” in English, who are hell-bent on stopping Leon.   Resident Evil 4 continues the tradition of offering an eccentric and ridiculous narrative that successfully links some of the franchise's biggest characters to its events but also stands well enough on its own that newcomers are not left scratching their heads.  The controls are solid and responsive but may feel somewhat strange to those that are accustomed to modern third person shooters. Leon is unable to move and shoot at the same time and must remain stationary when aiming. The camera also obscures a lot of your surroundings, adding to the overall tension and horror.  When it comes to the gameplay and combat, the Plagas-infected enemies present a satisfying challenge. They will relentlessly pursue Leon, often trying to flank him. Removing an enemies’ head will often just allow the Plagas themselves to emerge and engage Leon directly or swing around from the host’s neck. The enemies react appropriately to each wound, dropping their weapons or stumbling rewarding your aim with purpose and control. Shield bearing cult members and blind mutants with massive claws that must be dispatched by killing the parasites on their backs also refresh the enemy roster. Several satisfying boss fights provide the cherry on top of the Resident Evil 4 gameplay experience. It also features a great inventory management and upgrade system, allowing you to customize various weapons to suit your play style.  The greater focus on action does mean that scares are less frequent than they were in previous entries. Wandering around a hedge maze with Plagas infested wolves waiting to jump out of bushes and seeking keys whilst being pursued by wheezing, seemingly unstoppable regenerators are some of Resident Evil 4's few terrifying highlights during its three acts. While the first two acts are brilliantly executed, the third act loses a bit of momentum at parts, focusing more on action opposed to horror. This handful of minor grimace worthy moments is largely lost amidst the rest of the experience which will take most players fifteen or more hours on their first playthrough.  As if the main campaign wasn't long enough, Assignment Ada offers additional content as a mini game through the third act where you collect five samples of the Las Plagas parasite. Mercenaries mode challenges players to survive and kill as many enemies as possible. It's an addictive mode that would go on to become a staple of the franchise by enticing players with a risk/reward system, stringing together kills gives players a multiplier and breaking hourglasses extends the time of the session, providing a greater opportunity to post a high score. It’s a challenging variant on the gameplay that requires mastery of each stage to unlock further content and rewards. With these additional modes, it's really easy to get thirty hours of entertainment from Resident Evil 4. If that’s not enough, there’s also a Separate Ways campaign which acts as a mini scenario B filling in Ada’s perspective of the story with new bosses, viewpoints and a new area to complete substantially fleshing out the story.  The muted, earth tone rich Spanish village that serves as Resident Evil 4's setting is a massive departure from the dark, claustrophobic and sinister mansion from the first game and the post-apocalyptic city scape of the second and third games. When it was first released, Resident Evil 4 was one of the most impressive graphical showcases of the Playstation 2 and Gamecube. With a 1080p resolution, a frame rate of 60 FPS and some rescaled textures, Resident Evil 4 looks better than ever. It still looks its age but is still capable of impressing. The atmosphere is as rich in 2014 as it was in 2005 but it's still the same game and some low-res textures can be found.  Resident Evil 4 is a bittersweet experience, along with Half-Life 2, it helped foreshadow what was to come with new hardware as well as perfectly reinvigorating and updating a franchise that was in danger of losing its appeal as new hardware changed gamers expectations. In doing so however, Resident Evil 4 shifted the franchise's inertia toward action and with the next couple installments; Resident Evil would almost entirely forsake its horror roots. With the death of Resident Evil as a horror game, much of the survival horror genre fell into mediocrity with Dead Space being one of the few titles to successfully straddle the line between action and horror before becoming a victim of the same fate.   Resident Evil 4 is one of the greatest games of the new millennium. It maintained enough of the elements of its predecessors to be identifiable as a Resident Evil game while otherwise reinventing the franchise. Its timeless gameplay, great art direction and mostly excellent bosses make it very playable almost a decade after its original release. If you haven't played Resident Evil 4, now is as good a time as any.   TLDR?

57300,Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Great classic horror survival game. Okay so this is one of the best horror games I have ever played. What I like about this is that it is not 90% jumpscares and 5% chase scenes and 5% gameplay. It focuses on the story, yet still gives you the chills. Does not frighten you to the extent where it gets frustrating (Like Alien: Isolation as an example or the DLC of Outlast where you reach a point where you die and die and die till it gets so exhausting) Now, let us assume that you did not like the story and the scares (you thought they were too lame) here is the great part, you can get some Custom Stories from multiple websites that have their own version and some are very unique (that are obviously not related to Amnesia: The Dark Descent) So, if you did not like the story, you could get one of your own more or less horrifying story (depending on how you view this game) Unlike many other games that just want to suck your money, this game really cares about the experience to make it a little more unique so there is this little short but fun DLC pre-loaded (From the game launcher) obviously for free called Amnesia: Justine where it somewhat relates to Amnesia: The Dark Descent yet a little more challenging because your death is final and if you die you would have to repeat everything (Only in the DLC)  I recommend this game to:  -People who love games that have nice stories. -People who like games where you can get a lot of different custom stories/add ons to make the experience more unique. -People who like survival horror games. -People who have some time and money.  If you are a little unsure about whether to get it or not because it is $19 Go and get it NOW because there is a sale where it only costs $4.59! You have a chance till January 2! And if you want to be crazier buy the bundle where you also get Amnesia: A machine for pigs with it where you save money as well!  Good luck and happy holidays! :D",1,0

219150,Hotline Miami,"I really thought I hated this game at first. It ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off to no extent, and I had trouble getting higher than a B+. I truly thought this game was going to go into the pile of games that I despised and would nerver play again. But one day, I saw someone had gotten all the achievements, and thats really what brought me back to it, and made me play it again. 'Cmon! Just one more, and only 10 left!' I grinded for hours, and although a few hours of gaming doesnt seem like a lot, it does when you are only dying for those hours. I even had to search up videos on how to get A+. But once I got pass that god forsaked Chapter 9, I breathed a sigh of relief. If you are looking for a game that you can ace, but not be too easy nor hard, I recommend Hotline Miami.

As soon as i found out that this game was available on the steam market i didn't hesitate to snatch it up. Even now going playing on it just brings back so many memories, like long ♥♥♥ cheat codes...THE DREAM! Seriously everything about this game is great considering it's 10 years old! If you've only ever played the newer GTA's then your missing out. This is where ( in my eyes ) they really opened up. Adding features like modding your car, i'd spend hours making my cars look to just how i want them. Although you might find it hard to play due to the graphics are so bad it's like watching paint dry, remembeer that it's 10 years old! and even better than a lot of games produced to this day!

282350,NBA 2K15,"I don't know if I'm one of the few or even the only one here who's been experiencing the following problems, so far I've only been playing the supposedly classic My Career mode, but I have been infuriated by this buggy mess of a basketball simulation game way more than a few times in my first dozen of game hours:  first off, I have the habit of leaving video game story subtitles on for that after all English is not my mother tongue but this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game is the very first to ♥♥♥♥ me off so much with its badly written and synchronized subtitle display I had to turn it the heck off before I lost control and smashed my gaming laptop to scrap.  second of all, this game is filled with bizarre as f^ck and often creepy as hell animation and texture glitches, for example, when my player is shown walking back to and sitting on the court side bench in first person view, I can often see his head model... from the inside.. are you f^cking kidding me, 2K? you give us a FPV mode in this game and couldn't even get the basic job of hiding my character's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ model from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera done? As for animation glitches, did any one else experience during cutscenes seeing your character talking with perfectly done facial animation to an NPC in the game whose f^cking face is TOTALLY MOTIONLESS, and EMOTIONLESS? Was that supposed to f^cking happen? well it happened to me and I don't like it.  Last of all but definitely not the mildest problem here, they got some serious coding issues in this game that doesn't let you see it until it suddenly jumps out from the shadows and surprises the sh!t out of you with its erected d!ck in its hand ready to f^ck you in the butt -- right after my character was fouled for reaching-in in the middle of one game, an mid game cutscene began showing him ready to ''go medieval on the referee'' (as his teammate put it, whose face was motionless while saying it), and after this was done, when the game was supposed to go back to normal and let the oppenent player start shooting free-throws, the game got stuck.. by that I mean the camera was locked from behind the referee at the bottom of my team's basket stand focusing on his butt while showing everybody doing absolutely nothing, no one is passing the ball to the ref and of course the ref ain't giving the ball to the FT shooter. Every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ character was standing on the court chilling out making me feel that they all might as well be master.bating together cuz it'd be much more entertaining to watch. I had to quit that game (meaning simulating that match to the end and not getting my reward) and be stuck with another fifteen minutes treat of stiff-dead animation and god-awful subtitles -- because the cutscenes (especially the 'film watching segments') are f^cking unskippable -- before I could finally exit the game thru normal means and come up here to write up this review..  Probably gonna play more tho, just please fix this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mess. Thank you, 2k sports.  edit: by the way, before anyone says my rig ain't powerful enough to run this game, here's a non-pro version of my laptop's specs:  intel core i7 4710HQ 2.5ghz nvidia geforce gtx980m 16gb of RAM 1TB of HDD space with more than 100gb free on my game installation drive.",-1,1

The graphics are amazing, (facial expressions, weather, landscaping.) Story is really thought out, I like how you'll see a lot of returning charactors from the previous games. The new mini game is a card game instead of dice, which is kinda cool too. Kinda bummed you don't get to bang as many girls like the other games but im sure we'll all live, lol. Battle system is very fluid, you have a dodge and a roll to help you not get hit by sharpies. the walking/running can be a little lame, but its not that big of a deal to make a huge fuss. Overall, get it. It has tons of quests, lots of differant armor visuals, and its not a short game.",1,0

65980,Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth,"SMAC was a game about ideas and while the affinity systems introduces a compellling raft of ideas about the future direction of humanity, they are poorly realized and the starting factors lack any distinct Earth ideologies to meld with their brave new world.  Maybe after patches and DLC this game will be great but some interesting evolutions are marred by glaring problems.  Pros: - Traiding for favors in diplomacy is a great addition and when a trading partner spent favors to get me to go to war.. I listened.  - The refined spy system is quite enjoyable and can form a leg of new stratagies. Like running energy deficits made up for by periodic 'transfers' of large energy stores - The affinity system is interesting and a believable reaction to events on Earth - though the main gameplay is lacking in backstory and writting is not as grand or artful as in SMAC - The ailens are decidely not barbarians and those who handle them as such are not really getting that they are something different and other arrangements are possible - The tech web is actually very neat and I like the non-linear progress. I only wish thay had been more ambitious here and clearly made more of it optional for certain factors and affinities.  - The new virtures system is pretty good though prosperity is OP due to other health balance problems. Overall, virtues are as important to overcoming the harsh planet as the tech web.  Cons - No diplomacy victor and lack of luxaries means that aspect of the game is stilted as compared to Civ 5 or SMAC - a shame given the potential favors open up - Lots of visual and other small bugs - A step backwards in UI from Civ 5 with less information avalible on why things happen or what your built - AI is still terrible at war - only sheer numbers would work for it - I didn't even realize when I built my first wonder, they are underpowered and completing them feels underwhelming without any videos like in Civ 5 or SMAC - The writting is overall not very godo and this shows with both wonders and completed technologies. Also many of the quotes don't seem to add to either factor, affinity, or the earth backstory - Default factors just aren't that interesting, it's affinities that matter - Too many small quest decisions without a sense of direction or purpose. I hope any building upgrade quests are just removed as they don't really add much to overall gameplay  - Buggy quests, I get quests I can never fulfill due to their requirements being impossible",-1,0

237870,Planet Explorers,"Currently game presents a memory leak, which will eat through your RAM like it is skittles and go for your HDD. As well as there is a very useful vortex caching turned on by default, which may and will eat around 120 GB of space on your hard drive for single world. And it will brick your savefile if it runs out of space on your drive.  Other than that, if you manage to stop the game from bricking your savefile or ruining your HDD, it is riddled with lots and lots of bugs, including sequence and gamebreaking.  If you manage to sift through all that unfased - you will enjoy a decent exploration game with horrible and illogical story. I actually suspect that two teams of writers worked separately from each other and one of them was obviously inferior, because certain group and it's characters motivations are just plain dumb, while others are quite well fleshed.  tl;dr - That bunch who did programming for the game needs to be legally banned from writing anything more complex than 'Hello world' print in console.

261760,Lichdom: Battlemage,"Table of Contents: - Foreword - Graphics - Gameplay - Sounds - Controls - Quality - Overall Experience   -Foreword My friend told me about this game ~1,5 years ago, he said he really loved it and its amazing. Well, he's a huge fan of Magic (Spells and stuff), so, obviously this game is great for him. Well, i didnt talk to him for a year, i dont even know him anymore at all. I personally think this game is pretty cool. It gets boring after a while though.  -Graphics The graphics are insanely amazing, i love the level-design and all. Some people said this game runs bad on their GTX960 on lowest graphic settings. Well, i can just say AMD&gt;Nvidia. Especially in Price/Performance. Im currently using a AMD Radeon HD7970 and i can run this game on 60+ FPS on the highest possible settings with the highest FOV.  -Gameplay I really like the idea and all, but sadly the game gets really repetitive. Atleast for the first few hours. The Story is pretty bad. I didnt really care at all. Also the battling gets pretty repetitive. There are 8 different 'Powers' as much as i've noticed, you can only activly use 3 on your character though. If you want to use the others you need to get to that Checkpoint thing and switch, which i really like :3 Also, you unlock them by playing, you start out with fire, then get ice and more stuff! Well, its definetly a great idea, the implementation isnt that great though. I'd still recommend that game, especially for people like my 'lost' friend who love magic.  -Sounds The sounds are insanely good. The effects, Music, just everything is amazing. Didnt have such a great sounds experience for some time.  -Controls The game has inbuilt video tutorials that play when you reach a certain area where its required. That way you can learn all the techniques pretty easily. The controls are pretty simple and good. I like them. You can switch your different Magic Powers (Fire, Ice, etc.) with either the mouse wheel or the 1-3 buttons. You mainly use your mouse for attacks (LMB, RMB or both, also TAB works instead of both).  -Quality Its definetly a great game. I have not experienced any bugs except once, when i first started the game and changed the resolution, it crashed. But thats it. Other than that the games works insanely smooth.  -Overall Experience I do recommend that game, its great, but gets really repetitive after some time. I dont think its worth its 36,99€, but if you get in on sale, or in a budle for like 5-10€ its a great game. If you want to get this game for the story, dont even think about getting it. The story is insanely boring. I'd rather spend my time rewatching 'Black Bullet' instead of playing this game for the Story...  Well, i can definetly recommend this game if you get a cheap deal.",1,0

262690,Little Racers STREET,"Of all the small racer games i have played this one is one of my favorites for long time playing. In the beginning when you play the game the graphics and modelling of cars is a bit meh as one may be accustomed to more cartoony racer games like Bang Bang or Mini Motor or even 'realistic' looking like Real World Racing. This game reminds me of the later Slicks'n'Slide games on the looks. Few liked those either.   As you play the game starts to open up a bit and you start to like this more and more. Also filling up the garage with different cars and using them in various situations opens up entirely new scenarios that extends the experience.   Career mode is grinding - lots of it as prices of cars and tuning parts are very high - but still interesting as you buy and customize cars and do challenges using certain types of cars. There is always something to aim towards to.   Best part is probably multiplayer design. You can just put it on and either pop into someones game or host it yourself and keep on playing and if someone joins then they just join and there is no change to ever flowing races that keep on rolling with 5 sec lobby wait intervalls. No need to separate Career, achievement hunting or multiplayer. This is a brilliant idea from the devs as they probably knew multiplayer is going to be dead anyways so why not make it as open as possible to encourage social playing. No other racing game in my library has this. Others - that i have tested atleast - force you to wait in a lobby hoping that someone might pop in. Dead wrong! That does not work. MP is dead - universally - everyone is playing whatever is the genre leader. iRacing, Dota, whatever... dont even know if this particular sub-genre has a game that 'everyone plays' ?  Daily challenges keep one entertained too. Very tough times to beat there. but not impossible to reach a relatively high position either. i seem to score world spots 3-5 all the time so it can't be that bad.   Controls are spotless and car turns precisely like you want it. And getting good lap times is purely about skill.   9/10 - This one takes a well deserved spot in my library along with Mini Moto Racing Evo which is another game that i regard very high. Points could be perhaps a bit higher if the awesome MP section would be even more open and certain menu items and in game indicators would be more clearer.   edit: some extra words removed that did not belong anywhere",1,0

302270,Dungeon Defenders Eternity,"TL;DR - Everything Dungeon defenders orignal had + All DLC for the original + new DLC &amp; game restructure, combined for a tiny fraction of the price. #worth  Firstly, for those who don't know, This game includes everything from Dungeon Defenders Original + all their DLC released for that game. That totals to a value of £40 (~$67). This game also adds new maps (at least 4) and with the promise of more to come. They also have many new features that run throughout the game. They are only selling it for £15 (~$25) full price, with the game being on sale at the moment + the added discount for anyone who bought the Original game it is currently 70% off so it only costs £4.50.. what an absolute bargain.  At first glance you might think, 'How can they sell this as a new game? Is it not the same as the original?'. In short, No.  Here's why, the main reason this game is sold as a seperate game, is because they are trialing their new secure server system for DDII. The reason behind the servers is to intercept cheaters trying to modify any loot or equipment that they get. This was and still is a huge problem in the Original Dungeon Defenders game. The problem got so bad there that cheated items were being sold everywhere, mana could be generated and had no value, people were trading with items only obtainable from end game challenge maps. The cheaters essentially ruined the economy of the game as well as cheating and ruining the fun. There are also several new features that run throughout the core of Dungeon Defenders Eternity (DDE). There is a new currency, 'gold coins' they drop in game, from minions and from selling loot to the shop (or letting drops auto sell after waves). Many ignorant reviews of this game popped up as soon as it came out saying this was a pay to win item mall. It is not. The only items in the shop that appear to be sold for real life money are Emotions / Actions, which are costume specific animations a character can do ingame. Another new feature that runs through out this game, is the visual update to every piece of equipment your character is wearing and the new models for them. With this comes a selection of Dyes to recolour the equipment (bought with Gold coins not real money). The game feels so fresh and crisp, the characters have been rethought about and rebalanced so they scale appropriately. Text isnt continuously spammed in the center of your screen when certain minions arrive (a noise prompt is still there for those that relied on that). The minions have been rebalanced and they now have levels for easier understanding of their strength.  There is a new pet system, involving eggs and hatching them, with the new pets comes pet abilities! Also characters have slots for amulets that also give you abilities to use to help defend. Consumables are sold in the in game shop (for gold coins not real money) and they can be used in game to help you defend on the tougher maps. The same consumables and Dyes etc also have a chance of dropping in game, during waves from minions. Nothing about this game is pay to win.  Trendy is a very intereactive developer and will listen to the community and respond, this game is evidence of that. On the first day of release people were upset there was no Private lobby (unsure as to why, probably and oversight) and on the same day as they released the game they patched it adding Private lobbies and refining the match making system. They continue to strive to make their games the best experience possible for the user.  There's alot more I could go into about how much I enjoy this game over the original, but if you havent been persuaded by what has been said already then I guess there's no point going on. I would suggest ignoring any bad review with a play time length under 1-2 hours. As I am posting this review I have played 15hours+ and I have enjoyed every minute.

65980,Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth,LOVE THIS GAME!!! it's wonderfully refreshing if your a fan of the Civ Games. The map is astonishingly drawn and amazing details. I love the little mini quests and desisions. makes me feel more involved in shaping my people then what type of research i pick.. Cant wait to see what DLC they come out with. Hope it's soon as only 8 races to play with kinda hampers the game a bit. They could use a little loving they all pretty much feel the same to me not like past civ games where each race felt unique... Still LOVE the game excited to see what comes of it...,1,0
232430,Gone Home,"An utterly incredible piece of semi-experimental storytelling that demonstrates the power of video games as a medium, Gone Home is the ultimate antithesis of the modern AAA game. Set inside an empty house in the woods, the game tasks you with one thing and one thing only: explore. Despite some subtly contrived elements concerning the story's chronological order, Gone Home manages to masterfully tell multiple interlocking stories with real emotion and character despite featuring a total NPC count of zero.  At once tragic, adorable, warm, and even creepy, the only downsides of note here are the price ($19.99 at launch for a 2.5-hour game) and the fact that you can only play this just once... because you'll never forget it.",1,0

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"When I first got this game the moment on PC; I was expecting a bit of a buggy mess but actually it's a lot better than I thought however you need a Rockstar Social Club in order to play single and multiplayer. There were some glitches here and there but doesn't pop up far too much. I managed to beat the single player without much problems whatsoever. However I beaten this game on console so I am more familiar with the controller in comparison to the keyboard. I'd recommend playing on controller mostly because some controls with some parts of the game that would be troublesome.  Besides the bonus is that you get extra weapons once you are a returning player so if you link your Xbox or PSN account to your social club you get extra weapons; However I should mention right now there was a glitch but I was the only one who got the 'all in order' and 'loyalty' achievement which gives you an extra 2 million together. The other three should've got it but they didn't. In case you don't know it's the achivement if you get all heists in order with the same players. you get an extra 2 million. However the first heist only allows 2 while the rest allows 4 players.  I'd give this a 7/10 for multiple of reasons. First being that this takes place in San Andreas but the map is only one island; I was somewhat felt let down that it was not the same map as the PS2 classic remade in HD sort of deal like GTA IV was taken place in Liberty City. I would love to get an apartment from Las Vegas pyramid building. Second being some parts needs to be fixed, Hydra fighter jet with GTA Online needs to speed up when landing gear is away; Radio needs to have volume enabled so I can listen to self made music more better, the loyalty and all in order achievement needs to be fixed for the other players who didn't get it beside myself, Third being: The single player doesn't have difficulties but the checkpoints somewhat made it far more easier in comparison to the other games didn't feel as much classy and challenging as the games before..  Anyway the game is fun and a lot of room to mess around with and having a lot of fun with money.. Oh I should mention that there is Microtransactions in this game that if you spend a bit of real money in exchange for a lot of in-game money for GTA Online.",1,0

236870,HITMAN™,"Updated:  Just be prepared to spend much more time and fail alot more than you may be used too and eventually you might start enjoying the game.   After nearly 13 hours I finally finished the first 'episode' of this game. That doesn't include all of the different ways to take out the targets so there is plenty more to do. I watched a few playthroughs on Youtube and that helped in getting a better handle on the game.   For instance now I know that to put your weapon away you don't have to go into your inventory and switch to a coin or lockpick. You just have to hit Caps Lock (PC) and it will dissappear. There are a few large weapons that it doesn't work for but that's ok.  What I like.  Agent 47 has never been more sleek and handsome but he retains his signature mean glare.  The buildings and environments are ornate and majestic.  The guards make funny wise cracks based on what you are wearing even when I had on the pre-order Requiem Suit.  What I don't like In fairness I'll admit I'm a casual gamer and I like to play games on easy or normal, at least at first. The training missions are relatively easy but after that it seems a little too difficult. This game doesn't seem to have any modes like easy, normal, hard.  I've tried to manually save my progress a few times and sometimes it works and other times it doesn't.   I have a 970 graphics card and still need to run everything on low settings for the game not to crash and even then it still crashes sometimes.",-1,1

Giving us a roller coaster of emotion, they then told us, 'For only $30 more you can stay on the ride and you might just end up at a different gate, with candy and unicorns!' So, we shell out the money. We give in to the hope that maybe, just maybe those unicorns are just around the bend. Then, as the ride crawls to it's bitter end, we see that the track has brought us back around. The smug grin on Daedalic's face as they tell us, 'We said MIGHT.

360430,Mafia III: Definitive Edition,"This game is... disappointingly bad.  All the hype and news about it made it look like such an incredible game, almost on par with GTA. In truth, the game is very limited, badly optimized, with very bad physics. The action is pretty static, the cinematics are boring quickly, the game doesn't feel very interactive, but more like a movie that you cannot alter in any way. The AI is terrible. The trees, grass, the texture is just bad. JUST BAD! The FPS rate is terrible, aka the optimizations are just so bad, my GTX 1080 can barely pull 80 FPS in this game. I run GTA V maxed out (a game which looks way better, even though it's almost 4 years old) at about 120 FPS maxed out, while this doesn't go past 80.

It's puzzles are beautifully crafted and ingenious, but that is not what makes this game special. It is the perfect marriage of this gameplay with the moving, slightly cryptic story behind it that sets it apart. It creates a unique and special atmosphere which culminates in an incredible ending with a twist that changes everything. Even beyond that it seems the story might hold greater significance than you first think, and whatever the truth is of what it's a metaphor for, the game seems to have extra weight once you're aware of this. This is almost my perfect game. I mean it to be more than mere hyperbole when I say it transcends almost any other game ever made.",1,0

This game is significantly shorter than the original, but that does not mean it is not as good. I consider this to be a worthy successor to the original in every way. The plot adds to what was left off in the original and then some. The game is just as violent and action packed as the first.

Eight hours flew by as I survived day by day with my comerades. You get to see war in a new perspective and you get to see what war does to the ones not fighting in it. This game puts you in horrible situations and you have to make choices for your greater good, so you can live to fight another day.   You get to know the characters you're controlling, and you start to care about them. You really want them to survive. You do everything in your power to keep them alive, and you see the consequences. Sure, they might have food and meds for a couple more days. But what they had to do to get it, will stay with them forever. And you really start to feel bad for them. I, at least, felt really guilty after the first murder.  I really enjoyed playing this game, and I do recommend it for anyone who's slightly intrigued in this concept.

214560,Mark of the Ninja,"For any lover of stealth games, this is a must-have.  PROS: -An awesome repertoire of ninja skills to either get by undetected, eliminate your foes with traps and ambush, or instill fear and cause panic. Different suits selected at the start of level gives you these varied styles. -Smart AI that responds realistically to your actions -Huge sprawling levels to explore, that are also decently varied, from asian to modern to desert, for example. -Engaging story with many a punch, especially with the ending -Stylish comic book art style.  CONS: -Generic bad guys. Its hard to really understand why everything is happening, other than 'they are villains that want to kill you and also like to make weapons to kill ninjas'. -Can be ridiculously difficult to get by undetected, esp. considering the limitation to 2 dimensions. May require great patience, precision and timing. Of course, you can always go berserk and get by the violent way. -Lacks any kind of multiplayer or co-op -Low probability of a sequel, given the ending. I hope there will be one though. -Forced alarm sections was notably frustrating, given the focus and fun of stealth and 'ghosting'. Once an enemy is alert, esp. when accompanied by guard dogs, its stupid hard to get by undetected.  Negative point are mainly nitpicks, as otherwise the game is nearly perfect.   I highly recommend this one!",1,0

308420,Ziggurat,"I play a lot of procedurally generated games (not that I'm the most qualified), and I'd like to talk about why I would not necessarily recommend this game. NOTE: This is obviously an opinionated review, and as such I'd like to point out that my review is based on my personal experience with this game and most likely will not apply to everyone. Pros: First, the gameplay that is present in this game is extremely fun, precise, and difficult. The game obviously takes a lot of influence from games like heretic and DOOM. If that doesn't mean anything to you, DOOM and Heeretic were basically two games that defined the fps genre (evidenced by the term 'doom clone'). Additionally, it is immediately recognizeable that this game is tough. I died on the first room for my first couple of runs. After a couple of hours I finally beat the game on normal mode. This achievement holds significant weight and the feeling of accomplishment up to this point is amazing. In addition to beating the game, this feeling of accomplishment is tied to unlocking new perks (which are upgrades you can use upon leveling up) and weapons (should be self explanatory unless your an idiot).  Cons: I believe this game suffers from two main problems. For me, a roguelike should reward you as you play and get better. However, when rewards occur too quickly it can not only be overwhelming but also it can diminish the feeling of accomplishment. This is the first problem I believe the game suffers. After beating the game that coveted first time, I began to unlock up to seven things per run. While not necessarily bad, I found it a bit ridiculous when I started experimenting with what I could unlock with horrible runs. At the worst of it I unlocked five things without killing an enemy. The second problem with this game is that the gameplay has no variation. Allow me to explain. There is no duobt that this game contains amazing fps bullet hell gameplay that changes as you unlock more perks and weapons. However, other than those two things, the game doesn't change. The new weapons and perks change up the style of gameplay, but the core mechanic remains the same. Shoot. Kill. Advance. Additionally, the changing interior of the environments and weapons begins to lose its luster after you realize that all of the rooms and enemies are just cookie cutter copies of each other rearranged on the beginning of each level. Summary: This game has truly amazing gameplay heavily based on the frantic fps Hectic and DOOM. The initial feeling of accomplishment for getting better at the unforgiving gameplay is very satisfying. However, the lack of variation and overuse of rewards eventually undermines the the feeling of accomplishment that makes this game great. Overall, I believe this game is still very good and is definitely still worth a buy, but for the reasons stated above won't be a roguelike that I will be able to seriously commit some time to.  Extra: For other roguelikes that I believe are better suited for some serious commitment, I recommend: Risk of Rain, Nuclear Throne, Magicite, and Tower of Guns.",-1,0

This game is an action game and that is surely disappointing to old RE fans. but if you want a 3rd person over the shoulder action game than i would say pick it up.

365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"a fun game at first, but falls off quickly by being repatitious and lacky entertaining game mechanics. a lot of people compared this game to destiny, but the difference is destiny has an intresting combat system, which yes can get boring at times, but it's satisfying.   This game also feels too dead, i understand its a decolit wastelend esque game but the overworld is just running from one place to the next doing the same set of 4 missions.  'Dungeons' are good and fun to play as a team, but a lot of enemies are just bullet sponges and not in a fun way, the amount of health they have is just there to amp up the difficulty, higher level enemies only get more challenging by getting more hp and damage, not very intresting.  The dark zone is also a fun experience at first, then you get to people who sit at the level cap of certain zones and kill everyone. and players higher levels than you are much stronger than you, even you if you out plan them.   In short, don't waste your money im sad to say i did, got to level 12 and couldnt play it anymore.",-1,0
113200,The Binding of Isaac,"[4.8 out of 5 stars and pretty much my new favorite game.] The Binding of Isaac is a brilliantly made game and a great successor to the already awesome game Super Meat Boy with multiple references to the game. This game may offend some religious payers. As a religious person myself, I am not offended by this game. This game uses a brilliant way to encourage players to use every character. This way involves achievements being obtained for different characters completing different areas of the game. Another great attribut of this game is the fact that almost every achievement comes with a new item for the game. This expands the players experience.   The gameplay of this game involves your character starting in your basement. He shoots tears and the format islike that of the Legend of Zelda with a top down view. you have a slot for a spacebar item which can be activated after clearing a certain number of rooms of monsters. When you start the game for the first time, you will probably die somewhere between the basement 1, and the Caves 1. (Each stage type comes in pairs of 2 such as basement 2 and Caves 2 except for Sheol and in the expansion The Wrath of the Lamb the Cathedral and the Chest). In this game, if you die you have to start over in the basement 1.  In a floor/level of the game, you will find: an item room with a gold door frame which contains an item, normal rooms with enemies or without enemies, a store, sometimes an arcade (if you enterd a 2nd in the set of floors with atleast five cents),and a boss room containing a boos that you will have to fight. When you defeat a boss,there is a chance that a devil room(or possibly an angel room in the expansion). In a devil room, you will find either 2 items for sale by trading heart containers or soul hearts(blue hearts which can be obtained to shield your red hearts). This is the most common occasion. the other occurance in devil rooms is a fight with Krampus, a devil that can shoot blood tears and perpundicular beams. When you kill Krampus,(if you don't die in the fight) you will get an item known a sthe lump of coal.  Overall, the one thing that this game could improve on is making all of the characters a bit more even. I am not sure whether or not this is in the expansion version but when you defeat the boss Mom's Heart of It Lives with ???(everyone calls him blue baby), isaac(the starting character) will start each new run that you play as him with the dice(d6). The dice is a very over powered item witch makes every other character rendered almost useless except for the unlocks. Some characters are just straight up bad like Samson and depending on the situation, Eve.  I would give this game a 4.8 out of 5.",1,0
13230,Unreal Tournament 2004,"Obviously we all know UT2k4 was one of the best games ever created. Probably one of the best FPS's ever created. But does it hold up today?  Arena shooters are basically dead - the most popular one at the moment is Quake Live. So if you are looking for the current most popular shooter with the most people, go to Quake Live. Now if you are trying to re-live the glory days, you MAY have the ability do so here.  People do still play this game online. Most of the servers are the Onslaught gamemode. Very little servers running TDM/DM/CTF etc. So if you were into Onslaught, your in luck. If you enjoyed just pure TDM/DM/CTF, you might have a hard time finding a server. You can easily get the game to run in 1080P, and it runs smooth on W7. So no compatability issues at all.   Price wise I think $15 is a bit much for an old game, even if it was good. Make it $10 or less and I think it's worth the money. Out of all the UT's you could buy, this one is probably your best bet.",1,0

261030,The Walking Dead: Season Two,"Can they make Season 2 still interesting after Season 1? Hell yeah they can!  This review won't be so much about the basics of the game, since it's a sequel, so I will talk more about the differences/improvements of this game. If you like to hear more about Season 1, you can read about it in my review for that game, which I REALLY recommend playing it before this game (of course). I will avoid spoilers as much as possible from now on.  In this sequel, you play as Clementine. She has aged a bit, so she's tougher and more careful about her environment. The game continues on the choices you made in Season 1. You can still make a lot of different choices, but none of them seemed out of place for her in my opinion; she's still the sweet caring girl as you knew her.  This game is way more cinematic, and by that I mean the cutscenes look more different. They're taken from more different angles, the (face) animations are way smoother and the music can be intense. It also has way less glitchy animations, for example: if someone was staggering in Season 1, their model would shake/trip a bit. And in Season 2, I've only seen it once or twice in the whole playthrough, so that's a lot better.  Another difference between the games, is that in Season 1, you could investigate a lot of things, walk around and talk with other people between the cutscenes. In Season 2, they have limited this a lot. It didn't really bother me that much, since the story and the decisions you make within the cutscenes are still good, but it could've been a bit more I guess. Also, the story was more diverse in Season 1 and had more emotional moments, but that doesn't mean Season 2 doesn't have them as well.  Although this game is shorter than Season 1, it's still really good. It has a lot of improvements, the story is awesome and it feels like a true sequel. I liked both of them, since I see it as one big story. If you played Season 1, I definitely recommend getting Season 2.",1,0

The performance issue was annoying, but still playable, there were moments that initiated huge FPS drops.  After the latest patch that the team was working on has finally made a game - the game. The game runs nicely on Ultra. They also updated a lot of other things and added GearScore (basically to show other players how 'advanced' of a player you are). The graphics of Cryengine is as always pleasing to the eye, and the textures in this game (guns, gloves, equipment etc.) look amazing.  With a on the move weapon customization you don't need to be worrying for bringing the wrong weapon to the field, as you can customize your gun in-game, just make sure you choose the right right class for yourself before initiating the mission.  They also added 2 free maps which are really nice, and pretty big size with of course new missions and objectives.  From this day on, do not let the 'MIXED' reviews to bother you. The game is great and surely needed sequel to Homefront series. And always make sure before buying games that your PC can handle it.  *Feel free to add me for coop or helping you to start up.",1,0

368230,Kingdom: Classic,"This key was obtained from the developer for the purposes of the review.      Summary:   Kingdom sets its self up to be a game that could have rivaled the kingdoms of Sparta or of Genghis Khan, but immediately falls apart and collapses under its own weight. The game has a beauty to it that's not necessarily tied to its pixel artstyle, but more due to its animation quality and the little touches such as dirt kicking up as you gallop along. And it's a bit different with elements of tower defense, strategy, and base building games all rolled into one. And the game will keep you interest in its first hour or two. But then the signs of the games lack of content start to rear its head. The game shows its interest in the IOS platform because of its lack of controls and mechanics that it presents: the game's simple gameplay becomes repetitive rather quickly. Despite it being designed to be replayable, after two or three attempts: the game has really shown you pretty much its bag of tricks, and that's a major problem in the design area. Your lack of the control of your units will get you frustrated as they wander off doing what you don't want them to do, and you'll feel disconnected from everything that's going on around you. In the end, it won't be enough, and I have to say skip even at the game's lower price.    Gameplay Footage and Video Review:  https://youtu.be/QzbCfJy4pEg      Lists:    +:     Well put together soundtrack that's definitely worth repeated listens. Good sound design all around.    Game's aesthetic hits the little touches better then most other games, with dirt coming off the ground while galloping around, or the detail on tents that you look at. Very well done design wise.    The game is unique with its elements of tower defense, strategy, and base building. Interesting ideas at the core of the game.     For the first hour or two, you'll have some fun. But then....    -:     It won't last. Too little variety despite the procedurally generated levels creates a bit of a problem in a game designed to be repeatedly replayed. You'll see all the game has to show in 2 hours, or at least at its basic level.     Lack of control over units means that you're a passenger rather then a direct manipulator, and you'll feel the frustration of that when attacks that might have been able to prepare for if you had a bit more behind you can't be done. You can't prepare at all in any reasonable way.     No ways to see what's really going on in the majority of the field which sucks considering the view angle. Some will say that adds to the challenge, but frankly, it doesn't really add much to it, considering the limited gameplay in question.    I think with the combinations of other points on this list: the game attempted to go too realistic in its portrayal. Which is a problem, because what it does is hurt the game's fun factor.     The game plays slow, and I'm really unsure of why you'd add the stamina mechanic in the game that slows down gameplay even more.     It shows its IOS aspirations with the limited controls and frankly lack of options.",-1,1

You can choose between the following classes:  -Rifler: Both the German and US soldiers possess a different rifle which is good for long and mid range combat. The German rifles kill in one shot, but are bolt-action, the US kill in two but are faster. Both also have rifle grenades,  -Assault: Has an smg - good for close range combat, apart from the usual explosive grenade also has a smoke one.  -Support: Has automatic rifles good for close and mid range combat, but still useful in long range, has a massive recoil you need to compensate for, but its pretty simple since it only goes up. Has a grenade.  -Sniper: Self-explanatory, good for long range, doesn't have x-rair when unscoped but can still be used in close range like a rifler would.   -Machine Gunner: Has a machine gun which can deployed with a bipod and used to defend flags and other objectives. If not deployed the MG has a GIGANTIC recoil.  -Rocket: Has a Rocket Launcher that mostly kills in 1 shot. Needs to be deployed to shoot, good for eliminating snipers.  Some classes are better all around than others but each have their uses. There are numerous official and custom maps and its a fun game. The problems is there aren't many players. Furthermore, quite a bit of servers have dumb rules and you may as well be kicked or banned.  I would recommend this game if it's on sale.",1,0
249870,Scribblenauts Unmasked,"This game bored me. I was quite exciting by scribblenauts when it first came about, the hypes were high and so was my expectation though I haven't the time to try the game for myself. When Scribblenaut pops up on the weekend deals, I quickly grabbed the game with great excitement. A few hours into the gae, I find myself falling half asleep. The vocabulary library provided barely tug at my imaginations, my carefully crafted words often goes unrecognized by the game's limited understanding of how things should diverge as I see no reason why a marshmellow laser porcupine starship shouldn't be a thing.  Words aside, I'll still be plenty happy if the game was well made. The controls were horrible and unresponsive, there is a slight moment's pause after each command, lending to my frustrations.  There are no merits I can wholeheartedly give the game and with every second I see the game's title on my purchased games list, my heart aches with regrets and humility.",-1,1

361550,Cradle,"Play this more for its story and puzzle aspects than anything else. Sure, sometimes you wander around for a while looking for items you need because there are no hints as to where stuff is, and the world is kinda small meaning you'll visit the same two places the whole game, but the world is pretty and the visuals are uniquely beautiful.   The story deals with the concept of Neuro-copies and a plague that forces most of mankind into 'M-bodies' (embody, get it?). You work to revive your flowerpot android and then the two of you will uncover both of your pasts as well as the history of nearby Gerbera Garden. This game is very story-driven with a LOT of dialogue and text to pay attention to.  Secondary to the story is solving puzzles as well as a platforming 'mini' game where you collect blocks. If you're even slightly familiar with Minecraft you'll understand the essence of the mini-games. As for the puzzles, they aren't terribly straightforward but also not ridiculously abstract. Finding items you'll need can take time, but given that your character has amnesia I suppose it makes sense to not really know where things are. For instance, I spent the better part of half an hour looking for roots to grind up to put in my bird soup only to find them right outside the front door.   Lastly, there are some flaws with how some story stuff doesn't appear to tie together at the end. Keep in mind it is entirely possible that I forgot some stuff because playing games on Ambien causes me to forget a LOT. Anyways, I imagine that the pieces I missed are probably actually there in the form of text items I missed. In fact, there is a LOT of flavor text. There is a bit of a problem discerning which pieces of text are 'flavor' and which are 'main ingredients' at times though.   Anyways, if you want something with a good story, is fairly short (Maybe 4-6 hours including stumbling around looking for roots which are right outside the front door), has a nice puzzle aspect, and doesn't like quite like anything else I've ever seen; get this game. Just keep in mind there are a few flaws, some of which will get annoying (Like not knowing the roots are actually super close-by). At the very least, get this game on sale, but for the most part it's worth its price",1,0

If you step back and watch too long you'll find that no one really knows what the hell they're doing in this game. It seems most people follow a basic formula of: swing, back-up, swing, back-up, swing, side step, die/on to the next one. Anyway, the combat is absolutely ludicrous and highly entertaining.

259620,3079 -- Block Action RPG,"3079 is similar to a combination of Borderlands and Minecraft, as its a very open world, with a very 'blocky' look. I was attracted to this game due to the Steam Reviews, which seemed to indicate a very unique game, with lots of replayability and exploration. I have played this game for about 4-5 hours, not the 7 minutes reported, due to the game not reporting to the Steam Client as it opens up in a Java window....  Unfortunately, my experience has not been very good. Initially, the game would not run, and required 2-3 reinstallations from Steam to ensure it would open as expected. Once in the game, there is not a lot in the ways of a fluid or organic flow to the game. You sort of just walk around, hoping to figure out things as you go before you die. The monsters are not that exciting to look at, and the animations are very poor. I have attempted to play with a friend, and even then, the game was not any clearer.   I would describe this game as a cult-classic type favorite, where you either LOVE the game, or you HATE/DON'T UNDERSTAND the game. Unfortunately for the developer, I easily fall into the 'Don't Understand', and 'Don't Like' side. Since the game is cheap I find it hard to give a bad review, but this game unfortunately goes into my 'Pile of Shame'.  TLDR; not a great game, not well developed. very cult-like following, but was not able to enjoy.",-1,1

Unlike a lot of other SHMUPS, this is very easy to understand and is a blast to play; Chain to 8, and cash it in for sweet multipliers!   Other than that, it's just a damn fine game. Super slick, fast, and relentless.   Pros - Great scoring system - Good variety of ships; choose how you want to blast dudes! - Amazing OST - Entertaining amount of unlockable songs, alternate sprites, and backdrops - Accessible difficulty settings (with an interesting scaling system if you so desire). - FANTASTIC options. Being able to change colours and see hitboxes is A+   Cons - Ship explosions and bullets sound a little flat. - Some bullet patterns feel a tad too random (note: I probably just need to git gud)  - Achievements and replays are not yet implemented at time of writing.   TL:DR It's one of the BEST indie SHMUPS in recent times. Don't hesitate to purchase at full price.",1,1

231430,Company of Heroes 2,"Company of Heroes 2 is what I'd consider a great RTS game to deserve the title: Sequel to the best RTS game of all time. Often I hear so many people say how the game supposedly is dumb down or is just COH1 with reskin. I consider this nonsense since the game offers alot of things that are considered new and enjoyable to the game. 1.The graphics look amazing, even when compare to the original.  2.I love the new mechanics that add new tactics to the game, Especially how the map's settings can affect the game with blizzards and such 3.Although I haven't beaten the game's campaign, I tend to ignore the accuracy of the campaign and found it enjoyable. Even so, if you don't enjoy the campaign, there's always the theatre of war which people say is far better. 4.yes, this game has lots of dlc, but no one is forcing you to buy the dlc and the dlcs are not 'Pay to Win' dlc but rather Cosmetic dlc. At least dlcs aren't charging you money for stuff like maps like the Men of War dlcs. 5.AI is fantastic.

56400,"Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II - Retribution","the singleplayer campaign isnt too good but its also not very bad. repetitive levels though and a rather weak and short told story. still i had fun to hunt the achievements there and to play it with friends in coop-mode. bit annoying bugs there were, even before the migration from winlive to steam when achievements wont unlock, i had to play some races multiple times to trigger them.  the multiplayer is really great though. its just a good concept to ignore base building (which is boring in my opinion) and focus on the micro management of your army fighting for points. i like the great variety of units and abilities which allow different playstyles and lots of strategies. the biggest issue is and was the small player count in the multiplayer mode, still you find and found enough to pretty much always get some games going. the greatest mode for me is the last stand mode, i dropped hundreds, if not thousands, hours into leveling my heroes and playing for score or just for fun or to help others. it never gets old and you can always jump back in after some time. you will always find players there immediately. really poor is the support from relic though. the game still has quite a few bugs, especially after the migration from winlive, where the game started, to steam. this update really put a lot of new bugs in the game and took some good functions away and more or less was left in this state. there is also a so called elite mod, which truely most veteran multiplayer gamer play today. its different balanced and features some more units and even a new faction. personally i dont like the balance there and prefer the balance in the original game. it ever and ever gets modified which maybe has a charme in its own, so you can adjust yourself ever again.  after all superb game. im hoping on dow 3. but i dont have great confidence in relic when i see all the balance mess they made in coh2.",1,1

289070,Sid Meier's Civilization VI,"I tried really hard to like this game, the graphics and sondtrack are so good I wanted so bad to enjoy it, but I didn't. It made me mad, really mad, repeatedly.   If you found the religion aspect of Civ 5 to be a little obnoxious or inconvenient, well the made it 100x worse in Civ 6. Prepare yourself for a never ending flood (and I mean FLOOD) of Apostles and Missionaries converting your cities regardless of whether or not you have Inquisitors stationed there (oh yeah, it's a blast), also, they can attack and kill your religious units that aren't stationed in city. It's a real hoot.  As for city building, you'll be constantly fighting to build enough amenities and housing capacity to accomodate your growing population. You will forever be just slightly ahead of the growth, and if you fall behind get ready for zero growth and unhappy citizens that could revolt at any moment. Again, a real hoot.  Districts: barely worth the time investment until about the industrial age, at which point they finally get the upgrades you've been waiting centuries for.  Wonders: The best thing about them is their cinematic construction. Other than that, only a couple are worth more than the tile you must give up in order to build it. Sid must have been unhappy with the wonder hoarding possible in Civ 5 and made d*mn sure it didn't happen again.

465780,NewRetroArcade: Neon,"Good concept, atmosphere is good, looks nice and really authentic.  But it's incredibly tedious in the way you have to get everything to work.  I launched this game with the expectation that there would be certain presets and packs available for download, these are refered to on reddit, and reddit is what you get refered to by the developers of the game.  I can't find any links that haven't got removed or are outdated. I can't say I looked very long or well but I'm here to play some nostalgic games and not to 'learn' how this brushed up emulator works. A big part of the experience of an arcade hall for me in the very least is that you could just go there, not worry about anything at all because you dont have to connect or set anything up yourself, you're just there to play some good ol' video games and this feels like the exact opposite of that experience.  Got a gameboy to work after about 30 minutes, might just be me but can't find a single room with decent enough lightning to actually see anything on the screen of it... I geuss that's quite accurate but it's not really fun if I have to hold it with 1 'wand' and use the other one as a flashlight to see the screen.  VR also doesn't seem high enough res to actually display the GB's in a way where it's actually visible even with that flashlight, but that's not something I can blame on the developers of this game.  However, everthing looks nice, there's a lot of fun little details to be found in the hall, there's a lot of fun VR only things in it that you'd find in an actual arcade hall which are displayed in a cool way.  yadayada I cannot end a review; do not recommend this as it is atm, but judging by distance between updates and size of updates this is gonna turn out really good nonetheless.",-1,0

250320,The Wolf Among Us,"I really like the feel of this game. Thay have done a great job capturing the mood of the comic. Compared to series like the walking dead, a wolf among us, offers(to me) a more exiting story in a more interesting universe. Great voiceacting so far, and an intriging storyline. I cant wait to see where this is heading. Whenever that may be. Some updates about the realease of the next episode would be great!",1,0

333600,NEKOPARA Vol. 1,"So my family still think I'm some lowlife living in their loft with my waifu pillows and I can't really hold that against them cause it's true.  I think however, them seeing me on this game has led them to the verge of getting me counseling again but as this is a review of the game I can say, it's ♥♥♥♥ing worth it.   I played the demo for this game and by God was I blown away. The visual experience is astounding. I've never seen a visual novel look so amazing. The lip syncing is really good, the character animation is spot on and the general art is just brilliant as well. Who doesn't want to be surrounded by kawaii neko girls? That's right. Republicans.  The story is pretty good. You play as some guy who's ♥♥♥♥ing off to make his own bakery and become ♥♥♥♥ing Buddy Valastro from Cake Boss. Basically these cat girls who he's been living with while with his family go all Metal Gear in cardboard boxes in a moving truck to tag along with him and the story pretty much starts there.  They also have this OP song and video thing. ♥♥♥♥ me, it's like I'm on an acid trip. That ♥♥♥♥♥ amazing, like honestly, ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. I feel like I've been shifted from a visual novel to an anime. It's pretty crazy. Not only that, they've got a wide range of characters to meet so your not stuck with a few girls.   Might I also add that this game, THIS GAME! Has in the options a 'Chest Bounciness' option. Now, I'm pretty damn sure I'm not the only one here thinking this but DAMN! You know you've found a ♥♥♥♥ing good game when they have CHEST BOUNCINESS in the options menu. Genius.   Also I'd like to add that the price is great. The game is enjoyable and takes quite some time so for £6.99 full price or however much that is for 'Murica or other nationalities I imagine not that much more.   All in all, 10/10 will get hentai version.",1,1
500,Left 4 Dead,Wasted most of my teen years competing in this game. Won't regret a single hour.,1,0
221810,The Cave,"The Cave is a fun, enjoyable adventure, but it has a few flaws.  Let us begin with the good things it has to offer. It has a good sense of humor, even though some of it is hit-and-miss. It also does a decent job at managing the multiple stories. You'll be playing with 3 (out of 7) characters at the same time, all with their own story. As a result there's also a bit of replay value there for those who absolutely enjoyed it all the way through.   And while I liked it there were still a few things that bothered me. The first and most obvious are the blurry graphics. Yes, it uses a certain style, but it was still below my expectations. It's nothing groundbreaking, not as a game or an engine, so I expected better here. The characters are well animated though. It reminded me of something... I can't quite put my finger on it. But I do know is that I've seen this animation style before.   The puzzles are actually pretty decent and require some thinking. I had to use a walkthrough more than once. You see, I'm not that bright ;) And except for The Walking Dead (which isn't really a traditional adventure anyway), (point-and-click) adventures usually aren't my cup of tea. So forgive me if I say that I won't be playing it again with any of the other characters. One playthrough was more than enough for me. Like I said, it's a good game, but nothing extraordinary.   But, you might have an other opinion if you're a die hard adventure player, of course. I myself expected better from a studio that brought us the brilliant Brutal Legend, Psychonauts, Stacking and Costume Quest. You're better off playing any one of those.  [Rating: 71/100]",1,0

6250,Making History: The Calm & The Storm,"So I started out playing this game as the United States and naturally decided that I wanted to conquer Mexico, so I did. After that I kept going down until I hit South America and I stopped there. After that I decided I needed an ally so of course I chose Japan. The Japanese and I started taking over China when I decided to send Germany an alliance invite, they accepted and continued to roll through Europe. Eventually Italy asked to join my alliance so I accepted and they helped Germany start to take Europe. Eventually the UK got ticked off and declared war on us. It didn't bother me because I knew I had the better alliance but what I didn't realize while I was taking over China, was that Canada started invading my borders and took some states from me. Well I couldn't have that so I gathered some tanks and conquered Canada in a matter of turns. During this whole time Germany keeps sending Brazil invites to our alliance but Brazil kept refusing. I got sick of that and promptly invaded and took over Brazil.  During this whole ordeal Russia has sat there quietly refusing my alliance invites until the last couple of turns. Russia has started taking small European countries at an alarming rate. I probably need to declare war on them soon before they get to big.   10/10 Would start the Axis Powers again",1,0

360740,Downwell,"This game is pure and simple fun. Downwell is a game about falling down a well with gunboots strapped to your feet. There are four normal worlds, and a fifth world with a final boss. That might seem like a formula for a short game.  You are sorely mistaken.  In Downwell, you will die repeatedly, and you will probably rage quit too. But this game is too satisfying, too addicting, too fun to put down.   This game is a rogue-lite; a roguelike without all of the complexities normally associated with the genre. The levels are randomly generated, making no two playthrough the same. There are five playstyles, a harder difficulty mode, and 32 color palettes to unlock, with a custom palette maker on the way soon.  As of this review, I still haven't beaten the game. If you want to know more about the game, watch the trailer, and buy it for yourself! It's really cheap and you won't regret it!",1,1

323320,Grow Home,"Grow Home is simply one of the best small titles I've played. The gameplay is king in this contemplative and beautiful setting that is best described as Wall-E meets Jack and the Beanstalk. In it, you control an adorable little robot, Bud, on his quest to grow a giant plant into space. Not focused on difficult challenges, this game rather focuses on exploring and creating the world you inhabit, while subtly ramping up the tension as you ascend higher and higher and falling becomes increasingly punishing. Although there is little narrative outside the basic premise and the occasional encouraging prompt from Mom (your mothership), a subtle, Freudian overtone permeates the world. This provides the game its knowing humour and subtle world-building, while Bud's movements deliver the initial slapstick chuckles that set the tone of the game perfectly. This tone of amusing diversion helps to mitigate some of the frustration of plummeting to your doom after an arduous climb while the ingeniously simple climbing/grappling mechanic actually makes falling fun. I absolutely loved this game.   8/10",1,0

242880,"Sir, You Are Being Hunted","This is definitely a FPS that is for those with an acquired taste for this kind of game.  There are a lot of good concepts in the game. A randomy generated world, an interesting survival-esque style of gameplay, and an odd setting in general to keep you on your toes.  However, the gameplay feels sluggish. Also, limited inventory space is something that is seldom fun in any game: but it's even less so when your main objective markers (that are literally scattered around the world) have to be carried back to the center of the world so often due to small inventory space. It's backtracking that artifically increases the length and difficulty of the game.  It's not a bad game. And depending on your tastes, you may end up liking it a lot. But it's certinly not a game that can appeal to the masses.  5/10 'Mediocre'",-1,1

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Well what to start with. As I am not meeting the minimal requirements I had to play on lowest graphics, low resolution and with 20 FPS (It was sometimes lagging a bit but it's only because of my PC) and still the game was just beautiful. The gameplay itself may not be ideal but It's still great. Ofc there are some annoying bugs but only few. About the story, it's sometimes intresting, sometimes funny, sometimes dramatic, everyone can find something for himself. Anyways let's talk about minuses of the game. First one and the most annoying for me, game itself is designed for consoles. You can play with keyboard and a mouse without bigger problems but while riding a horse, dodgeing or even attacking you'll feel that it's most comfortable to use a controler. There was only one bug that forced me to reload the save and It was an enemy stuck in the wall.  Now the final verdict is: The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is close to be a master piece, it has wonderful graphics, intresting story, great humor implemented and very good combat system. I would surely reccommend you to buy the game, complete the story, start the new game + what is a great free DLC btw. and focus on exploring, side quests and leave the great main story for the end.  P.S Remmember that you can export saves from both Witcher 2 and 1 what will slightly change the story (depends on your choices) and is a great addition :)",1,0

My game gets a solid 60 with a mix of ultra and very high settings and I'm running on a 980 and i5.

237990,The Banner Saga,"This is a great game to grab if you own a macbook pro or an air. I play it on PC too with no problems. It runs great, plays very well with other apps, slipping in and out of full screen nicely (at least on OS X Mavericks). It's also gorgeous. And hard... very hard. There are few games I've dropped back to easy mode on but I was getting so frustrated with not being able to progress in the story that I did. And it has still been challenging. Lots of branches in the story and different characters to level so the replayability looks very good. Did I mention it's gorgeous?   Maybe it's because I'm a father with a daughter of my own, but I also found the storyline between Rook and Alette to be quite touching. There is little actual spoken dialogue but what there is makes me wish they had been able to do more, especially for some of the characters, not just the narrator.   I think the only thing that bothers me a little sometimes is the isometric view can get a bit mucky in big fights with a lot of characters and I would love to be able to see things easier. I think that is the only gripe I can think of. I hope the people that made this game keep making more. Best money I've spent for some time.",1,0

293180,Overcast - Walden and the Werewolf,"Overcast - Walden and the Werewolf is an indie horror/adventure game using the Unity engine and is made by a really small studio (basically a single person did all the work, programming, design, sound, etc.). I feel it's important to begin with this, so one might lower her/his expectations before judging the game too harshly. But even without being harsh, unfortunately the game can't really be called good.  The game has an interesting premise and setting: we play as Walden, a retired hunter and duellist who lives as a hermit near Ravin, a town set in a Western world. One day, following his intuition, he leaves his cabin and decides to visit the town and its inhabitants. This is where the game begins.  The gameplay consists primarily of shooting (in first-person mode) and finding our way to enter the next area (the game calls these chapters 'momentums'). The concept is pretty basic: our hero wields a single shot rifle and we must constantly back away from our enemies while shooting and trying to kill them before they can catch us. Ammunition is scarce, so we have to make every shot count (there aren't many enemies though, so it should be enough). More importantly if we miss, our opponent will probably catch us and it's game over immediately, which means we have to start the whole chapter (they are usually 15-20 minutes long each) over again. So further simplifying things: by shooting an enemy, we gain time, the enemy either dies or loses speed after being hit, while we have to reload our rifle. While reloading, we have to try and back away from our opponents as far as possible, because they are usually faster than us and reloading takes quite a long time. Basically it's like playing a slowed down version of Doom using the double barelled shotgun. Problem is, we all know people around the Wild West used winchesters rather than single shot military rifles. To make things worse, Walden isn't a literate person apparently as he has never heard of silver bullets. Oh well, wish these were the only problems with the game.  The first half of the game is definitely good: the locations are spot on, the cabin of Walden, the dead town are both well made (strangely enough we don't have to fight anything here, it's just all about atmosphere and jumpscares). This atmosphere takes a hit when we reach the uninteresting cemetery (an otherwise great and obligatory location for horror games) and the spider infested dungeons. The design of the dungeon is pretty terrible: it consists mainly tight corridors, there's not a lot of space to back away and retreat from the enemies, the placement of them is predictable and it quickly gets very repetitive. At the end, the final enemy awaits.   And no, it's not really a werewolf    The real problem comes with the design of the monsters, especially the spiders (the small ones can kill us with a single hit as well): they are all ghostlike looking which can make them hard to spot and they also seem to lag sometimes, just to appear in front of you in the next moment. The so-called werewolf has the habit of disappearing (turning into a ball to be precise) only after a few shots and it's often hard to tell whether he is finished off or only slowed down for the moment, still requiring another shot.  The game displays some minor adventure elements (making our clothes wet in order to enter a burning cottage, using an old cannon to make way through a caved in passage), which sadly degrade gradually into key finding as we progress through the story.  The graphics is all right for an indie game, but the character models are pretty rough. Many people criticized the surrealistic visual effects, but I actually liked it, even though I do admit it is way overused (there's a part where Walden gets poisioned - it should have been used only then). What rather annoyed me however was the look of the extremely blurred enemies, which made my eyes hurt (not to mention how impractical it was, not knowing whether I have finally made my antagonist retreat or he is just gathering his strength for another attack). It's obvious the blur effect is used to cover up the minimalistic graphical realization of the character models which is a pretty cheap solution. The cuscenes show 3d models in stationary positions with various lighting effects and I'd say they are OK, if you played indie games before, you've certainly seen worse.  What stands out is the music: while also pretty simple, just like the rest of the game, it's quite fitting and sets the mood with its Western(ish) guitar based tunes. On the other hand, the sound effects are irritating and way too loud.  The last fight with the lackluster ending and finding out the real name of the werewolf affirmed my feelings that Overcast - Walden and the Werewolf is not a good game. It comes close being a minimalistic, cheap enjoyment lasting a few hours, but the gameplay (pressing the S key and shooting things) just ruins it.  PROS + first half of the game is decent + music is pretty good + it's very cheap  CONS - second half of the game is bleak and boring - game concept is flawed and uninteresting - character models are terribly blurry - sound effects are cheap  RATING 4/10",-1,0
290300,Rebel Galaxy,"Yes, with caveats. Rebel Galaxy has lots of style and some cool ideas and the core ship combat is fairly fun and I dig the Firefly/Bebop vibe. You kit out your ♥♥♥♥ with various beams and misslies, mines, flak cannons, broadsides and etc.   But the gameplay loop is too short and simple. You grind missions to get money to get better ships/parts. Move to next system that's a bit harder and do it again. Somewhere in there you do a story mission. That's about it. The story is fine, but also nothing to write home about, nor is it surprising. There are NPCs you intereact with and a couple guilds to join, but the ineractions are bare bones. You do missions for reputation and eventually they like you enough to buy some faction specific ships. There's some economy stuff in the game, but you can safely ignore it for the most part, unless you absolutely must sell your loot at the highest prices at all time. It's faster to just pick up more missions to do. You fight your way through the main story anyway, so going out mining seems more flavor than a thing you're intended to do.   I'd like to see more complexity in the systems of your ship. You get bigger and bigger ones, so having to manage some crew could be a welcome layer of complexity. You can set the gun AI to fire on targets based on ship class, distance and, etc, but it's really not been neccesary.   I'd be into a Rebel Galaxy 2 if they add more complexity to the base systems. I haven't finished the game yet, but I'm on rank 5 parts, and I think I'm getting close to going to the system where the final missions will probably be. I'll update this if something changes in the final hours, but I doubt it.",1,0

The gameplay is very messy, it's hard to find out where your character is and what is exactly displayed on your screen as soon as there begin to be a bit too many ennemies or explosions going (which happens pretty frequently especially when you're playing with 3 or 4 players simultaneously). It's also hard to know whever your character is in range or not of an ennemy on the depth axis.

You get to chose an archtype which is a class system for Shadowrun games. With the tabletop version you can be like James Bond Bruce Lee and so on. Thus archtypes. In game the archtypes are reduced to combat for the most part. However, you can still take skills that work to give you a few more choices in responding to NPCs. Also a few options that effect your game.  I still say to get it on sale too.",1,0

289130,ENDLESS™ Legend,"What most people will be asking about this game is how similar it is to Civ and is it BETTER than Civ. Firstly, despite having many similarities in the type of game it is and the way it's played it is actually very different. Secondly, in my opinion it is a far better game. The rest of this review will try to explain why.  The most obvious difference is that here you have a fantasy setting rather than a historical one - which you prefer will simply be a matter of taste. The first major positive is that you can level up heroes and give them progressively better equipment based on what you have researched. Standard units can also be upgraded in this way (through the edit unit feature). This is FAR more useful and interesting than the single purpose you can give generals/great architects etc in Civ. The second major positive is that the factions you can choose from are a lot more diverse and different in the way you go about playing each of them compared to the positives and negatives attached to factions in Civ. This gives more replay value whilst also making multiplayer more interesting. Attached to this diversification we have the fact that each faction has its own individual quest/mission thread making single player more varied by faction also.  The unit types, whilst very different at a faction level, are quite limited. Some may find this a drawback in comparison with Civ but, personally, I find that it is more useful in both highlighting faction difference and STREAMLINING what you can produce during multi-player. Whilst this is true, you can also assimilate various minor factions (of which there are many) that may make extra unit types available to you meaning that armies will almost always be different even in games with multiples of the same faction.  Other, non-battle related, research is also limited in comparison with Civ - the research trees here are much smaller. Again, this makes multiplayer more viable and streamlines the whole process.  There ARE negatives associated with each of these improvements but also combat is more straightforward and less complex as is how you govern your cities. There is a lot less micromanagement in Endless Legend. Whilst this may be a big turnoff for dedicated Civ fans it will be a welcome difference for most players and, once again, aids in streamlining the game to make it viable as a multi-player experience.  Overall I feel that whilst both games have merits and problems and neither are perfect, Endless Legend provides a more interesting experience in single-player due to faction difference, hero use, and quest lines. And Endless Legend's FOCUS and streamlining of research, production, and city management make it more viable for multiplayer. 82%",1,0

Even though the game has some bugs and issues to be worked out, the game is still fun to play (even though it's almost three years old) and it doesn't frustrate you like some other games :).  As for recommended settings, my advice for players is to install it on an SSD drive, rather than a standard SATA HDD.

394970,DEADBOLT,"DEADBOLT is simply one of the greatest games I have ever played. But that might be because I'm a huge fan of games like Hotline Miami.  Be forewarned, DEADBOLT is not a walk in the park. You will die. But with each death comes oppurtunity, a chance to make things right. Ammo conservation and accuracy are among the most important things in this game, next to being able to use lights and vents to your advantage. Luring enemies away from one another so you can pick them off is an important strategy you'll have to exploit in order to survive. Fighting more than one enemy at a time is usually suicide. But, just because going in guns blazing is dangerous doesn't mean DEADBOLT is a stealth-only game. You're free to complete missions anyway you want, which means you can either go in only with a knife and never be seen, or run through with an SMG and gun down everyone in your path.  Also, the soundtrack is fantastic! My only complaints are that the cover system is a bit weird, and that the game isn't very long. But there is a hard mode which is only unlocked after completing the game that changes almost all of the enemy positions, so that adds some replay value.  I paid full price for this game and wasn't disappointed, but I'd still wait for a sale, even if it's only 10% off.",1,0

As in it intended to have more content that was likely cut due to time or some other limited resource =(  These issues are easily overlooked due to OTTTD being f-ing fantastic. It is a solid turret defense game running on complete goofiness. Its not just turret defense, its also rts and RPG. Somehow it manages to juggle all these genres and fuse them into a smooth and satisfying experience.  HOWEVER. As I said, the game is incomplete. There's a bit of an uneven increase in difficulty as you progress. The solution, of course, is leveling up your heroes and buying them better equipment. How? By grinding. Over and over. I hate it, but it doesn't ruin the game.  I bought as part of a bundle. Wasn't expecting much. But I'll tell you this: had I spent $10, I would've gotten my money's worth for how long it hooked me. A little disappointed in the lack of variety (there's only 2 theme worlds) and permanently locked characters on the select screen, but it is what it is.

230230,Divinity: Original Sin (Classic),"I haven't had this much fun playing an RPG since Fallout 2. The dialog is great even when spoken. The graphics are perfectly suited to the content, meaning it's pretty easy to see what's what. I have encountered a few bugs but they were all of a minor graphical variety. The combat is very fun and satisfying when you figure out what you're doing wrong and adapt tactically and then succeed. I have been surprised. I've laughed out loud, a lot. I can't stop talking about the fun I'm having playing it to all of my friends and family. I have fully spent over 24 hours straight playing Divinity and I didn't notice really till after the fact. I would have bought this game for $60 but now that I know what it is I would have paid more. The designers basically dumped the tool they used to make the game into players' hands and you know there are going to be some amazing mods down the road. What's not to like? I can't think of anything that's too bad. Sometimes moving things around in the inventory can drag but that's because I steal everything that hasn't been nailed down despite not really needing to. (There are sorting buttons for all of it that make it easy but I forget to use them and go scrolling through the whole list anyways). I mean, you never know when a broom might come in handy, my shovel sure as hell has.   If you haven't liked an RPG in years despite playing all of them anyways; play this one. Just Play It. Do your inner child a favor and go someplace cool and prevail against the odds in Divinity.",1,0

In some cases mechanics got worse from the first game, such as ground-takedowns being glitchy/tougher to register than in original!

396650,ACE Academy,"I have already reviewed this game many, many times and I can do nothing but sing praises for it... I stand by every word I've said about it, every last one. This game has become my absolute favorite VN; a ton of options that really change up the dialogue which amps up replayability by an enormous amount, all major routes feeling very satisfying, a very interesting world to play around in and learn about.  Artistically speaking I love the style it's very pleasing to look at and its mild animation is nice, the writing (save for the cringe-worthy-yet-charming-to-some-extent references and humor options) is very well done and very natural. Also the more detailed Mech artwork; superb, simply superb. I still can't say much about the Voice Acting as again I don't really care for voice acting in my VN's but if the voice direction has the same care as the dialogue options in the writing then I'm sure it's just fine.   And the ending, no spoilers, is extremely well done and all the routes are highly satisfying.  This is still by far one of the best VN's I've played and in fact has become my 'bar' as it were. I've honestly been having a hard time enjoying other VN's due to the fact 'eh, it's not as good as Ace Academy'.. If you haven't bought it and enjoy this type of game (visual novel, lots of choices, cute girls with fun routes) then I highly suggest you do so, it is still entirely worth it.  I highly look forward to this teams next project.",1,0

377530,侠客风云传(Tale of Wuxia),"So this game is really fun...for me; and anyone else that really ejoys wuxia novels, manhua, etc. Frankly, the game makes you feel like your living a wuxia novel. Lots of different martial arts and inner arts to cultivate, many of which only are stumbled upon by chance or as a reward for something. You decisions in the game actually matter and leave a lasting impact on the game from then on out. The mini games for collecting resources are kinda silly but are quite fun. The combat is a fairly straight forward hexagonal turn-based strategy with a few tweaks added in. But even so, there is enough depth to keep each new combat fresh and interesting. However, before purchasing this game, be aware that progression is rather slow and can at times feal a bit grindy. This is because you actually train your characters aspects one by one with minimal stamina for any actions each day. You can go through the days fairly quickly but often times events or conversations will add to this time spent cultivating. However, it is possible that through adventuring (taking a stroll) that you can stumble upon a great chance for sudden increses in stats or new arts. Long story short, Its a wuxia novel in game form where you control the story. If you like that sort of thing then this is the game for you. If not, you can still enjoy it but i doubt you'll last through a full life...unless you die really early on which is very possible.",1,1

237630,DuckTales Remastered,"I'd love to recommend the game. It's a beautiful game and WayForward and Disney have given it a lot of love. I could write many more paragraphs about how well-crafted the and game is than this review takes.  However I can't recommend it. The game has a catastrophic bug that causes the game to freeze on a significant number of users' machines, including my best PC. It appears to be a problem that is occurring with an increasing portion of new players and one suggested option to reduce (unfortunately not eliminate) the problem is to lower the graphics settings, resolution etc. so it seems likely the issue happens most when the game is played at its best. It is more frustrating still that this freeze happens mostly at the very end of the game.  But the most annoying thing about this is that Capcom are being wilfully neglectful of all of these complaints. Players have repeatedly contacted them about the problem over the last 2 1/2 years. WayForward, the licensed developers, have also tried to communicate with them to offer work on fixing the issue. But all of this is being rejected, so nothing can be done. It turns one of the best games and certainly one of the best platformers of recent years into one of the most aggrivating.  Instead I would recommend looking into other WayForward-developed platformers where they are not restricted in such a way, and where such issues cannot be found. In particular the upcoming Shantae: Half Genie Hero is shaping up to be a wonderful game with similar aesthetics and handling.",-1,1

330420,The Interactive Adventures of Dog Mendonça and Pizzaboy,"If you have read any of these tomes before you know the routine: I backed this game on Kickstarter and OKAM studios stuffed me in the game (complete with a speaking role but a tenor, not my usual bass) so if that is too much connection for this very partial review, feel free to read elsewhere!  Dog Mendonca &amp; Pizzaboy is based on the comic book series of the same name with the artists now working to bring their adventures to the computer screen. The game keeps the feel and pace of the comic but in an adventure game format. Text boxes are used even though there is fine voicework! I particuarly like the light pencil marks in the text boxes; it provides a great tie in to the comic box adventures. That said, you don't need to have read the comic books to play the game; it stands up just fine on its own.  Dog Mendonca is the last surviving Werewolf. He and all the remaining monsters now live in Lisbon, Portugal (see the first comic book); Dog is a private investigator who keeps the monster world and human world from colliding too much! He is helped by Pazuul (a 5000 year old chain smoking demon who looks like a 9 year old girl), gargoyle (who got tired of hanging out on church roofs) and Pizzaboy, his unpaid intern. The four of them run around Lisbon in a blue and white VW bug keeping an uneasy peace.  The game starts out with a nice nod to Monkey Island 2 and a quick tutorial that sets up the characters and shows you how to use the interface. But quick enough, the team gets hired by a young lady investigating a gypsy curse and some strange going ons. Quick enough, Dog is captured, Pizzaboy springs him but then Dog vanishes and Pizzaboy suddenly finds himself hip deep in monsters, ghosts, cult film artists and amusement park employees. In short, Pizzaboy is in for a long night as he tries to find Dog and solve the mystery.   The game is not too long and the puzzles are not very difficult. I played it off and on in three evenings. Pizzaboy keeps good notes and his notepad provides some nice hints. You can't go wrong playing the game. Several of the interactive spots only really work when you can progress. The game has you working on a couple of puzzles at once so there is some fun in trying to understand which item you collect works on a particular puzzle. There are no dead ends (just dead characters and even those can often still deliver a good line in the game) and no circular traps or insane logic to solve puzzles. There is some pixel hunting but the highlight areas are large and I found them quick enough. I do want to note this is not a game for the youngest players; there are enough occult references and some language to keep the younger set away.  In summary, a fun little game, some fine humor and a nice entertainment for yourself for a few evenings. Pizzaboy knows how to deliver!",1,0

281990,Stellaris,"Feels like a empty shell of game, waiting for DLC or mods to fill the void. There is very little gameplay beside exploring early game and then later managing pops. War is boring since it's just your big fleet vs theirs and whoever wins that wins the war, save just the mopping up afterwards. My gametime comes from one game mainly where I had nothing to do but accelerate time and click different researches when the time came. Research choices aren't very interesting either, aside from Society tech tree the rest just seem to be flat bonus'; 5% this or that.  There is very little automation I feel because the devs probably knew the gameplay is incredibly sparse, so all that clicking you do and micro is just to fill the voids where interesting gameplay choices should be.  It's not a great 4x game and it's not a grand strategy at all either, despite devs saying it would be a hybrid of both. the UI is obnoxious and feels like it's designed to slow you down and get in the way at all times. Diplomacy is a joke and there is no espionage.   The anomalies are the biggest disappointment to me so far, when you compare the impact they have to say the events in ck2.   Your king falling off his horse in ck2 could lead to a massive spiral of vassals revolting, or people plotting to have him killed. Just getting scarred in battle could have major knock on effects. In this game you fail a anomaly and it's just a binary effect - scientist is killed or it disappears. What about all the crazy stuff that could happen, diseases that kill pops; brain parasites that alter the ethics of a region drastically. Awakening a sentient AI that claims an area of your space, in sci fi the possiblities are endless.  I had a Nostromo type chain event, and I thought it might unlease a xenomorph outbreak, but all that happened was I got a society bonus. That was one of the most interesting ones too.   They are just glorified barbarian towns in Civ. A flat bonus and nothing else, a few free advanced ships. I'm seeing them repeat a ton too. So much for all the hype pre launch about how they would shape your empire's narrative and tell stories. As it's not a historical setting like their other games they needed to add more story and events to flesh out this setting. There is no flavour in this game at all so far.  I imagine it will continue to be updated and improved as with their other titles, though I'm not sure what can be done when it has so many game design issues nevermind a big lack of content. I expected a much better product on launch than this, and I'm someone who buys their other products on launch and this is the worst launch since hoi 3 . I recommend not buying it till at least a few major patches. Though the 1.1 patch fixed nothing really.",-1,1

282900,Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1,"as much as i want to love this game. im gonna hafta give it some bad scores. even so i still recommend it. first off the controls must be memorized to realy get a feel for the game because all explanation of controls are still listed in their original platforms gamepad. while the game does have a menu you can look too for keyboard layout.. unless you find the buttons to acess the right menus it does little good. so for those who want to know: while on map and in dungeon the 'o' key opens the ingame inventory/system settings menu. the buttons used for different attacks in battle are 'u' 'i' 'o' or 'enter key' for the bottom attack option as default. and for using items in battle press 'r' to acess secondary battle options and the 'k' key to use items. for these annoying reasons only i give the controls a 4/10 score. ah the graphics: i loved the graphics in this game very nice. so far it has never frozen for me and remains clear even in the worse of situations. 10/10 for graphics! gameplay and storyline: i realy like the storyline but find some lingo to be even beyond my knowledge so it makes me think they were trying to reach out to even the most esoteric references just to put a smile on your face. and for the gameplay it was going fine until the west wind valley(dungeon number 3 without dlc). when i reached west wind valley at lvl 8 or 9 the balance between you are your enemies stayed good but when you reach the end of the zone thinking ok im lvl 10 or so now lets try this boss fight. no.. its not just 1 boss fight. its 1 boss fight folowed by another boss fight. you will not win. I had to grind till i was lvl 17 to stand a decent chance. now dont get me wrong i dont mind grinding, but when you have to grind nearly 10 lvls just to be a match and hafta use ALOT OF ITEMS IN THE BATTLE, its kinds ridiculous. and to put this calculation into perspective for you(once you hit lvl 12 you have to kill everything in the valley 2wice to get to lvl 13 so you can imagine this was a long process. and im not even gonna mention the dragon in the valley other then dont try to fight it till you reach lvl 25 (min). so for a score 9/10 for storyline but 6/10 for gameplay &lt;--mabey a little too generous. and lastly for those who wanna know. DLC does not make the fighting and gameplay broken. i kinda wished it did (or atleast made it easier for me) so for a overall score of 6.5/10 for the game. not a bad way to waste time if youve got the 'memory' for it.. haha",1,0

251150,The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky,"I wish I'd liked Trails in the Sky more than I did. It sat in my backlog far longer than it should have, and perhaps my expectations got unfairly bloated with hype, but for whatever reason I can't fully recommend this title. I stress that it is in  no way  a bad game, but when it comes to JRPGs and the investments they require, there are better contenders out there more worthy of your time and money - two things many of us do not have in abundance.  Curiously, Trails is made up of a lot of great parts, though they all seem to have caveats. The characters are fun, if clichéd, the writing is lively, but there is far too much of it, the combat has some really neat ideas, but ultimately feels slow and repetetive before the end. One thing I can unconditionally sing the praises of is the fantastic music, which I never tired of.   I loved seeing convetional JRPG storylines, that often feel a little melodramatic, bucked for Trails' episodic, 'villain of the week' stories full of grounded drama and reasonable threat. I also really dug how the game naturally curbs its difficulty after a crushing defeat. If it wasn't for this smart offset I probably wouldn't have finished Trails as by the time I reached the final (difficult) dungeon I was spent, and not looking to give the game too much more of my time. That would have been a shame, as the eleventh hour twists and final cliffhanger were impactful and well written, and made the forty hours it took to get there  almost  worth it. For all the tropes it shook and the JRPG mechanics it defies, Trails suffers from poor pacing more than anything.   A game needs to respect a players time, especially in an age where our Steam libraries are no doubt bursting with hauls from Humble Bundles and Summer Sales. Our cup runneth over, and this leads to Trails in the Sky's biggest downfall. It doesn't respect a players time, it unneccesarily pads out what could have been a tight, engaging twenty hour experience into a much longer slog full of less-than-stellar content.   I enjoyed a lot of Trails in the Sky, but ultimately there are better things out there to spend 45 hours on - and I wish I had.",-1,1
231200,Kentucky Route Zero,"This game makes me want to go visit the Mammoth Cave area sometime just on the off chance some of these places will actually be there. Great story, gameplay, soundtrack, and plenty of obscure references to early adventure games thrown in.   Part 3 was worth the wait and I am sure Part 4 will be as well. Cardboard Computer has some freeware games on their site that are tied into the series while you're waiting.",1,0
208090,NA,So far I have only been able to play for about an hour (in-game) but my time playing was AMAZING. The matches were always filled with action and there was never a dull moment.

241930,Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™,"If anyone ever told you that shadow of mordor is a bad game you should punch them in their ♥♥♥♥♥ face as hard as humanly possible.  in terms of helpful information consider the following:  This game plays very similar to the Arkym series of batman games with the free flow combo/counter system, you'll see all the tell tale signs as you play and it feels comfortable although not as nicely polished as the combat system in Arkym city for instance, you get away with quite a bit and countering is very forgiving but dont let that fool you. you'll get over run and killed in no time if you're not careful. which brings me to one of the only problems. there is literally next to no punishment for dying in this, if you die the guy who killed you gets promoted and becomes a new target for you to hunt, when you respawn at a nearby tower not only has everything gone back to normal but you GAIN experience for getting your ♥♥♥ handed to you. it's bizzare really but strangely enough fits in just fine with how the story flows. Combat feels good if not exactly tight, you'll find that managing 2 dozen orcs is suprisingly easy, tho throw a captain in there and it all goes to ♥♥♥♥.  All in all a fun game if you like getting into the thick of it and a must have if you are a fan of LOTR at all.",1,0

Stuttering, tearing, sync issues - there's been no improvement since at least the September patch. I've been a PC gamer for 30 years and this is arguably the worst release I've seen since BattleCruiser 3000AD from a stability standpoint, considering the amount of time they've had to fix it up.

227700,NA,"This may be my first review. This game is awful enough that it deserves it.  Tried playing this for about 6 hours, ran into so many bugs during the time I actually needed to recreate my character twice, and finally ended it when we (friend of mine and myself) were repeatedly refused to enter a mission, and were disconnected a few times instead.  This game has no place on the market, free or not. It's not playable. Do not download this game. It is an utter and complete waste of time.  While in game, we noticed very very few players, the market had a very slim amount of items, there were basically no random camps or spawns anywhere on the open map, and the game heavily limits what you're allowed to use by what class you choose.  Absolutely could not recommend this game to anyone. The production team should be ashamed. Steam should remove this from the store. Awful.",-1,0

269030,The Yawhg,"The Yawhg is an interesting game. This review will have small spoilers for gameplay stuff, as there isn't much to spoil in the story as it is different every time you play. I won't spoil specific events that can occur, but I will talk about the general flow of the game. It IS a text heavy game. It consists of reading text, then choosing how you will respond to a certain event, and then reading the effects of that choice before moving onto the next character. After doing this for each character playing, you move forward 1 week   You spend 6 weeks with 2 - 4 characters living their life. You as the player know a monster called 'The Yawhg' is coming, but the characters in game don't. Each character does one action for a week, then a transition to next week occurs with a bit of information about why The Yawhg is scary. You repeat this for 6 weeks, then the Yawhg comes and you choose how the characters react to the aftermath, followed by seeing the fate of the town, and your characters. After that the credits play and a new game starts. I won't go into the specific of what can happen, as that is something you will have to discover that for yourself. I recommend you do, as it is a very interesting game.  As of writing this, I've completed 3 playthroughs and feel there is a lot of game left to play. I've gotten a couple of very different endings and very excited to see more of them. If you get a dark, bad ending the first couple of times, don't worry that is normal (at least for me) just keep trying to make things turn out better.  In conclusion, I'm not going to call this game 'good' or 'bad' or give it a rating. Because, in my experience they never really matter. I recommend just buying the game, and experiencing it for yourself as it is well worth the price.",1,0

403640,Dishonored 2,"performance issues aside, this game is masterful. every level was beautifully crafted - the environments are simply stunning.   i did my playthough with emily, and she has some amazing new powers that allow for awesome kills. the puzzles in this game were a lot of fun, it was very rewarding when i was able to complete them and collect my rune/bone charms. as in the first game, bits of lore were scattered throughout the world - it makes the empire feel like such an epic place, and really ties the story together (and ties to the original game as well).   can't wait for the patch, i'll do a second playthrough as corvo when that time comes!",1,0

But the true joy, the best aspect other than its inventive rendition of verbal dueling and strong sense of mystery...  ...the writing. Oh lord the writing. The characters are simple yet deep, and the game is filled with excellent world-building and flavor. And no game deserves to have succinct quips and on-the-nose banter than a game about verbal dueling.  Please do yourself a favor and give it a try! It is exactly as long as it needs to be, and you'll still want to replay it to find every little bit of text and flavor you can!",1,0

292120,FINAL FANTASY XIII,"Final Fantasy XIII is not an usual open-world jrpg like past titles, however the story (which is always the backbone of every Final Fantasy) is no less stunning and original. The design and atmosphere of both shining utopian world of Cocoon and wild, dangerous and abandoned Gran Pulse is just so original, you will never know where to look first. Although the visual side of the game was apparently top priority for developers, all of the other aspects are not so bad as people like to claim. All of the characters have their own motivations and troubles, and even though i didn't enjoy unfolding their stories as much as i did in Final Fantasy VII, or Final Fantasy IX, it was in no way boring.   From very start of the game, you must forget about how our world works and patiently absorb the atmosphere and working of Fabula Nova Crystalis universe. There is no explanatory intro and you are thrown into conflict between two sides you don't know, in place you don't recognize on a planet which is apparently freaking inverted (reminded me of standing on the inside of Halo ring). It comes slowly and I spent a LOT of time browsing through 'datalog' (kind of in-game encyclopedia and journal) so the mild feeling of confusion is something you should expect from the beginning. I personally enjoyed the slow exploration of this strange sci-fi, fantasy, mythical world however.  The combat in XIII is an interesting mix of direct action (your character) and indirect role selecting (two other characters in your party) which makes for a lot of ways to play. Just look at youtube and you will find that everyone uses quite different team compositions. Generally the combat is fast, stylish and definitely feels like Final Fantasy type, although you won't feel so much of control over the exact actions of characters, as you did in past games. Too bad the character development is kind of straightforward one (at least until over half of the game) and sometimes i felt like a machine putting experience points ('Crystogen Points' or 'CP' in-game) into the skills and attributes chained one after another with a little choice which one to prefer of leave behind. For example, for a mage caracter Hope, even if you want to max preferably 'magic' attribute, you sometimes have to 'waste' a lot of CP into strength attribute, even when you know you won't use it, just to get to those 'magic' ones.  I finished the game recently and the beautiful EPIC finale left me with no doubts about quality of this game however. Even though its sometimes more of a movie, than a game, its still a must for every fan of series and I would recommend it to every other player, who likes rpgs with strong story, fast action and japanese sci-fi world filled with strange but beautiful magic and myths.  I personally had no trouble with graphics or other port issues as some people mentioned.",1,0

291650,Pillars of Eternity,"Overall: 7.5 / 10  A great game born from the ashes of point-and-click SRPGs, such as Baldur's Gate, Torment, Fallout and Icewind Dale, but bogged down by copious amounts of dialogue similar to its predecessors.   I enjoyed my journey through Pillars overall, but there were times where I found myself bored with the world, often skipping through dialogue just to keep the story moving. There's just so much of it, and it's beautifully written, but you can easily spend more time reading than exploring and finding things to murder for experience - the main reason why I enjoy RPGs.   Character progression is very similar to the Dungeons and Dragons system, which wasn't the most interesting choice but does the job. I will say that the combat difficulty curve is a bit wonky as you will find yourself steamrolling through enemies one second then laying down to return the favour the next. I died many times wandering into an area that I wasn't levelled for without warning, having to doubleback to level up a bit more. With that said, there is a little bit of a grind to overcome. As a tip, your best bet is to progress through quests to gain experience instead of engaging in combat for the first 5-10 hours, a long time to be sure.  I was really impressed with the artwork and how each map felt completely different - they were fun to explore and solve puzzles in.  As a completionist, I couldn't bring myself to do everything in the game, but I did complete the main story and dozens of side quests. There's a lot of game on offer here, but as I mentioned earlier, it can turn into a chore when the writing is as dense as it is. I just don't have the patience to read a book while playing a game.",1,0

377690,Starlight Vega,"One of the few rare lesbian visual novels that are already translated, or in this case made for a english audience.   The Art is interesting, very much a western style, though admittedly it appears that the person who drew the standard interaction CGs and the one who does the more intimate ones was totally different. The latter being far more high quality, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it can get a bid distracting. I imagine this had something to do with more funding.   Overall the story is fairly simple and choices in the game do make a impact on the various endings you get, and even make sense in most ways in terms of how they turn out. Unfortunately the loves scenes are fairly short and the nudity is lighthearted, seemingly designed for either for all ages or tastefulness as some people might say.   Still quite a good read and recommended to anyone who's into visual novels and particularly those that like Yuri.",1,0

However, the game is grand and epic, and so has many ups and downs. Again, that's part of the beauty, although it means right whem you think you have it made, the rug is pulled out from under your feet -- or vice versa: anything can happen. Additionally, the game has incredible research behind it, and you will find yourself on Wikipedia or in other references to learn up on parts of history you weren't even aware of, and that you would not have otherwise found interesting.

If you want 60% cut scenes this is for you. If you would rather have 25% cut scenes and 75% game just skip it and get the stand alone 'The Old Blood' instead for less money (I got both and was much happier with the latter).  Trust me.

204450,Call of Juarez Gunslinger,"Possibly the most fun I've had with any entry into the Western genre,  Call of Juarez: Gunslinger  has pretty much every iconic element of the Wild West that you could ask for in a game (except horse riding). The only Westerns that might beat Gunslinger in my book come from the very same IP, in a series created by Polish developer  Techland , the same group responsible for  Dead Island .    In addition to iconic scenes, lore and activities, the player is treated to excellent story delivery through the bounty hunter Silas Greaves. He's a big talker and actually narrates his own story to a small crowd over some whiskey in a saloon while the player essentially relives his memories by going through the motions. The excellence in this episodic format comes from the playful characterization these developers inject into his tales, many of which end up being a bit 'tall.' It provides some thoroughly entertaining moments. Developers seem to be utilizing overt humor to more and more advantage since the advent of Borderlands' success.   The story itself is solid. I found myself enjoying the villains while rooting for Silas, who is something of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ himself. Visuals and audio are good by modern standards, the game runs beautifully on a decent machine and there were no bugs or issues that I could find. The art direction seems less gritty and more colorful than in some of the CoJ predecessors.   The First Person Shooter formula is well done here and has a combo point system tacked on to encourage flashy moves rather than boring, mechanical efficiency in dispatching foes. Those combo points earn experience for a mini-progression system that specializes your bounty hunter into a close range heavy hitter, long range sniper or fast-firing, guns blazing dual six-shooter. Design for a few areas is commendable for facilitating some great shootouts. The dueling mechanic is great in campaign but challenging enough that I gave up on it in the actual dueling mode. Other gameplay modes, which I briefly played and finished at the lower ratings, were fun but low in replayability value.    I took the time to read the history blurbs that can be discovered along the way. Part of what makes the game feel like an authentic Western are these cards plus the pseudo-historical events and figures featured in Silas' recollections. I have always been a big fan of speculative, historical fiction so this is just the kind of thing I want to see more of in games and other media.    If you're looking for a linear, straightforward, almost arcade-like first-person shooter that captures a genuine Wild West feel along with some Borderlands-esque color and humor, you will be pleased with Gunslinger. I recommend it to any Western fan as well as FPS players in general.  TIP: Avoid the easy and standard difficulties from the very start; opt for hard or 'True West' for a much better experience. TIP: Duels require some serious focus! Multitasking the two components is harder than it looks. TIP: Perks from the Ranger skill tree for revealing secrets throughout the game are of limited use, however if you are good at generating combo points you'll have more than enough experience to fill one tree and start on the other two. TIP: The Trapper's armor perk and the Desperado's dual wielding perk are useful to have early on, even if you are primarily Ranger.",1,0

The controls are natural, and the way that the markets work is very good, you need to explore to get certain guns for free in store, and the world is huge and very much open to explore. I couldn't be happier with my purchase of this game. I highly reccomend it. I found the nudity in the game to be uneccesary, but not a reason to miss out on such a good game otherwise.

292120,FINAL FANTASY XIII,"Let me begin by praising the overall art design and fantastic focus on contrasting color schemes in each environment. The music is also enjoyable if somewhat bland, in comparison to any other Final Fantasy game.  This is where my praise of the game ends.  My primary complaint about FF13 is that you don't so much play the game as you watch the game. In the first five hours of game play, approximately two hours were comprised of the characters standing around reciting the same lines about l'Cie, Pulse, The Purge, etc. FF13 is not so much a video game as a theatric movie with some interactive portions.  The dialogue is also bad... very bad. For a theatric game that is composed mostly of pre-scripted FMV segments it would make sense to focus on coherent, enjoyable dialogue. Instead, the five characters insistently repeat the same nonsense over and over again. There are a few keywords (l'Cie, Pulse, Purge, etc.) that are continually thrown out for effect with long, unnecessary pauses. I get that Japanese culture is different, but every time a character opened their mouth it felt like a teenage melodrama.  The use of JRPG archetypes is paper thin: • (Lightning) Lead character is a woman so she has to be a cold, callous ♥♥♥♥ • (Snow) Has to constantly announce his desire to save the world/his GF • (Hope) Constantly gasping and making shocked noises of fear/concern • (Sazh) Token black guy • (Vanille) Literally the Jar Jar Binks of FF13  In the game play department, FF13 no longer uses the traditional random encounter style of action. In fact, it doesn't use any type of recognizable RPG fighting design. Instead, the game has literally incorporated an Auto Attack feature to strip the user from having to do ANYTHING! It is unconscionable for a game, particularly an RPG, to have an auto-play function. The user is transitioned into a bystander; a passing observer instead of a participant in the game.  The environments, while beautiful, are comprised entirely of narrow hallways and corridors. Again, this is meant to restrict the user experience and bottle them into pre-determined events and battles.  TL;DR - Terrible JRPG nonsense plot with nonexistent game-play that panders to the modern crowd of graphics-first, content-later players.",-1,0

286570,F1 2015,"Currently, this isn't a game I can recommend.  The new 'TV-style' presentation is excellent, and it's very pretty when racing. The car handling feels like a big step up from previous games, especially with a wheel: where I could comfortably drive the cars with all the assists off in previous games, I'm struggling to do so here, because the handling is much more (presumably realistically) knife-edge. Just slamming the accelerator or brake won't do you any good, and you need to feel what the car's doing through the wheel.  So, the  driving  is pretty good. Unfortunately, the  racing  is dire, at least in single-player. I've had the AI randomly change line, slam into the back of me, sideswipe me mid-corner, and I've seen multi-car pileups on seemingly innocuous corners.  The braindead AI, coupled with a fairly buggy experience (steering randomly failing, UI flicker and inconstency, overlaid icons in menus, and periodically disappearing car parts) mean a game that has a clearly fun core is currently unplayable.

308320,NA,"I enjoy playing golf. I enjoy various golf variants, from 'Calvin ball golf' to 'Improvised course golf' to simple and pitching around the yard. I enjoy computer golf, dating back to old Dos games with polygons so sharp you could cut yourself on them all the way up to various iterations of PGA games and even an old NES Mario golf game that I had back in the day.  I also enjoy management games, because I'm boring like that. I've played various manager games from stock market sims to football, hand egg, and baseball managers.  I do not enjoy this game, however. It's clunky, local coop is even clunkier, there's no feedback on what impact the items/employees/housing/car/training/what-have-you actually makes on your character and their play style (I'd like to pretend they matter, but after 2 hours I'm still not seeing any consistent changes anywhere), and the golf 'minigame', such as it is, is a joke without a punchline.  The minigame first off suffers from the fact that it's so forgettable that you can actually skip over it without realizing it. Just click the 'sim the day' button one too many times and you've skipped right over it. Next up, local multiplayer is a pain in the tuckus. The game makes no effort to help you find your characters, so you'll be sifting through a million names to find the ones that you actually made. Once you're actually into the game it becomes a bit of a buggy and poorly made affair. The game seems to pick your default club based on random chance rather than what would actually be useful for an approach, if you don't designate where the ball is supposed to go then it's pot luck whether you even shoot it in the right direction (regardless of your stats(!) and even with the wind turned off), and the 'triclick' function (the bit where you could have any real skill involved) is completely unusable on my computer. It zips along at a million miles per hour, and there's no way to click it accurately because of that. I think this game was made for much older computers than my fairly dated and lack luster gaming rig.  The game suffers from a few other bugs as well, most notably in having some items incorrectly priced. Save your game before you go shopping, because there's no undo button and it will happily let you go tens of thousands of dollars into debt.  In summary, if this were a $2 game or even a $5 game I'd recommend it only for management fans. At $20, I recommend not buying it unless it's in a bundle. Even then, there's better games that work better, look better, and are infinitely more enjoyable. If the minigame looks fun then I'd recommend looking for some freeware golf games, as there's several out there that look the same and play better.",-1,1
381940,Trials on Tatooine,"This should be titled 'Trials of Waiting', as literally all you do is wait. There was like 30 seconds of gameplay in 6 minutes of waiting. On top of that, what gameplay there was was extremely boring (deflecting lasers)). The visuals were too awful for anything to look or feel realistic, especially after trying out The Lab.   This was the first VR experience that I felt was just a complete waste of time and I would have been better off never installing it in the first place. Unless you really really want to hold a lightsaber, spend your time on a different VR demo.   I feel like anyone who claims this is worth your time has never tried any other single VR experience in existence, as really this is less fun than watching a VR youtube video.",-1,0

236870,HITMAN™,"Game is amazing. I've played previous Hitman installments but this one blown me away and I think it is the best so far and that it beats even Blood Money.   Pros:  - A lot of different mechanics that work perfectly together.  - Really big amount of different weapons availible for you to use. - Even tho new composer doesn't beat Jesper Kyd in his mastery, soundtrack is still very neat. - Beautiful graphics. - Dark humour moments here and there. I think it's always good to see a game not taking itself TOO seriously. - Sh*tload of different ways to take down your targets.  - You can choose different suits to wear. - HUUUUGE maps to explore and play around. Biggest in Hitman series yet. - Each map seems to live it's own life. Almost each NPC does something.  - David Bateson back as Agent 47. Sounds badass as always. - I don't really care what other peaople say about episodic release. I think it's very good for game like Hitman. These games always reminded TV shows in some way.Now when each episode is released month after previous one you don't feel such preasure to play next one right away. You get time to fully enjoy each contract, discover almost every detail on the map. - Elusive Targets. Every 2-3 weeks, there is new Elusive Target availible for you to take down. You have only few days or plenty of hours to take it down. If you die you fail the mission and can't redo it. You can take down each target only once as well. - Untill now story seems to be pretty damn interesting. - It will be the biggest and longest Hitman game yet. It will have around 19 episodes in total. 1st season which uncludes episodes (+ 1 bonus one if you got full season) is out now. There are 2 more seasons coming.   Cons: - Reused voice actors. You hear same voices anywhere you go. - Everybody in every country speak perfect English.  - Instinct mode (which is basicly X-Ray vision seen in almost every 3rd person game today), Oppurtunity tracking (Each contract has around 10 different oppurtunities for you to use. Oppurtinity tracking makes game extremely easy. It literally tells you what to do to take down a target like in a tutorial.) and Minimap are active on start. They make game too easy and take away what makes Hitman great. Finding and later figuring out different ways to assasinate your target. Thankfully they all can be turned off in the menu. - Optimization could be better. - You need internet connection to have acces to chellanges, elusive targets and custom contracts.   In final verdict, I totally recommend buying it. It's worth it's price if you know what Hitman games are about and you like it. I think it has a chance to become Game Of The Year.",1,0

211400,Deadlight,"Deadlight is a beautiful game, but the graphics just aren't enough to salvage it.  The core gameplay is fun enough, but the controls make it more frustrating than it needs to be.  It's challenge level is fairly accessible, but the last chapter is a straight-up rage game, brutally difficult only because of the surprises it throws at you the first time through.  The backgrounds are incredibly detailed, but they'll have you wondering why your character doesn't just take the clearly visible stairs instead of forcing himself through jumping puzzles.  The main character is reasonably well voice acted, but he's surrounded by a cast reading a laughable script in bad American accents.  The story is nothing new, with an ending you'll see coming from the first cutscene. Although, if you play through the game on Nightmare mode, I guarantee you you'll be surprised -- the secret ending may make no sense at all, but at least it is unexpected.  Two final notes: there's no in-game reward for gathering all the collectibles, so it is safe to skip doing that, and this game has absolutely no Metroidvania aspects at all -- it is a perfectly linear platformer from start to finish.  All in all I can't recommend Deadlight but if it is on sale for cheap it might be worth it for a few hours of themed jumping puzzles.",-1,0

2600,Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines,"Great game for 2004. Good graphics, plot, dialogue, and gameplay, despite some tuning issues. If you want to play the game multiple times, start with Toreador, the sort of jack of all trades, or at least don't start with Malkavian, because their dialogue best saved for later. Try to stick with 5-7 skills, any more and they will all start to suck. Stealth is kind of useless when you can just 3 shot people instead. Guns suck early game and you don't really get a lot of ammo until the last few levels. Also, do the entire tutorial, I skipped it and had to beat the game without a lockpick. It's free experience and ammo too. Research is arguably the best skill because you can use it to upgrade other skills if you can be bothered to find skill books.  It's a bit hard to find a guide for builds, so here are my thoughts:  Combat: Melee &gt; Ranged &gt; Unarmed Defense is almost necessary  Covert: Research &gt; Hacking &gt; Lockpicking &gt; Sneaking &gt; Inspection  Mental: Persuasion &gt; Seduction &gt; Intimidation &gt; Haggle  Discipline:  Thaumaturgy (3 or 4) &gt; Fortitude &gt; Protean &gt; Potence &gt; Celerity &gt; Animalism &gt; Dementation &gt; Presence &gt; Obfuscate &gt; Dominate &gt; Auspex  Also, download the unofficial patch and any mods you want.

204100,Max Payne 3,"The Good: DirectX 11 visuals look stunning, fun and past paced action, bullet time is used well, superb camera work and cinematography, one of the most engaging stories in any recent shooter, lengthy story mode  The Bad: Some bullet time quirks, last-man-standing has some issues, gameplay is a bit shallow and feels repetitive some times, scripted bullet time events are spread too thin  Max Payne pretty much took bullet time effects mad popular by The Matrix and made it mainstream for games. Back in the day Max Payne was a high-tech graphic noire story by Rockstar Games. It was fun, full of action, and had a great story and character. The second game did the same thing, but felt too familiar to the first game. The third time around is a decade later, but Rockstar now has the tech to do what they originally wanted. Max Payne 3 is one of the best looking games out there, but also features one of the richest and well delivered cinematic stories in recent gaming history.  Max Payne has retired and is just mourning the death of his wife and kid while getting drunk every day. An old buddy from the police force stops by and recruits him for a body-guard job in Sao Paulo protecting a very rich family in a third world country. Things go wrong, like they always do for Max, and he needs to redeem himself and set things straight after so many screw-ups through the game. I can't say much more without spoiling the story, but you're in for a treat on this one.  The game feels familiar once you start getting into it. You can dual wield weapons or use a two-handed weapons. Bullet time is back with bullet dodge as well. You can get behind cover and use bullet time to pull off headshots and kill a dozen enemies that would normally kill you without it. Bullet dodge is fun to when you don't have cover or just want to knock some guys down quickly while moving to cover. My only issue here is that it isn't as fast as previous games. Spinning around in bullet dodge is slower and feels too weighty for me. Max's bullet time meter only refills if you stick your head out and start killing enemies without it so there is some balance. If you get hurt you can pop painkillers, but they aren't in abundance like the last two games. I don't think I ever had over 4 at one time and they are hard to come by.  That's pretty much all there is to the action. There are many different weapons with things added on like laser sights, nightvision sights, scopes, and flashlights. I really wish the gameplay was evolved a little more, but all you do is shoot everything that moves. There are some great cinematic moments that break this up like bullet time shooting in different scenarios which is really fun. I just wish it wasn't spread so thin because a lot of the time the game gets extremely difficult and repetitive with too many of the same type of shootouts in a row. At least the environments change all the time so you have a lot of different scenery to look at.  Max Payne 3 has some of the best camera work and cinematography in a game that I have ever seen. At certain points the camera will snap to the last enemy in the area that is dying so you can pump more rounds into him as he falls. Then the scene will go right into a cut scene seamlessly and then right into another action sequence. I don't think I have ever felt like playing an action movie before more than I have with Max Payne 3. The game is also really long with 14 chapters that will take about 12+ hours to beat. The story is just bursting at the seams with detail and lots of scenarios to make it not seem rushed and incomplete.  There's a multiplayer mode that can be pretty fun as well as an arcade mode to keep you coming back. You can play through the main story again to find all the golden gun parts and clues if you want for achievements. The game also plays better on the PC due to the pin point precision of a mouse, and the addition of the latest DirectX 11 graphics which will require a monster rig to run at a decent frame rate. I didn't find any major problems with the game, just a few annoying ones that were persistent throughout the whole game like the difficulty imbalance, some bullet time quirks, and actually a big issue with last-man-standing. If you have a pill bottle left and you die you get a few seconds to shoot that enemy and Max will automatically consume the bottle. If Max is flopping around or turned around you have to wait for the reticle to automatically face the enemy. If you are out of ammo you're screwed. Some times objects will be blocking your shot and you get screwed there too.  Overall, Max Payne 3 is a wonderful game with top-notch cinematography, superb voice acting, and high-end visuals. Fans of the first game will be pleased with this lengthy shooter, but the gameplay itself can be repetitive, and shallow some times. The cinematic bullet time events are spread too thin, but it can be forgiven due to how wonderful everything else is. Max Payne 3 was well worth the 10 year wait, and here's to hoping there is another one.  ~Score: 8.5/10",1,0

227000,Primordia,"A fun point &amp; click adventure developed by Wormwood Studios. This is their only commercial release to date but they did do two games for Indie Speed Run 2013 called Like a Raisin in the Sun and Salt. It takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where all the humans are gone and you play a robot named Horatio Nullbuilt. You have a broken down ship that you live in and another robot breaks in shoots you and steals your power core. Now you are on a mission to get it back.  Gameplay:  It plays just like a typical point &amp; click adventure game. Finding objects to use and figure out puzzles to progress further in the game. Puzzles were a little challenging for me but were fun to figure out. They require some logic and can have multiple ways to figure them out. Choices you make in the game can change things later in the game. If you’ve played other adventure games then you’ll have no trouble playing this.  Story:  It kept me interested and curious to dig deeper. It all starts out over a power core but there’s a deeper secret you can uncover if you make the right choices in the game. Great supporting cast which brought some comedy to the game. I really enjoyed the banter from Crispin your little sidekick throughout the game. There’s also seven different endings to the story if you care to see them all.  Visuals &amp; Sound:  It has retro style graphics with some great looking hand drawn rooms. They did a great job of showing you a dark and grim world. An easy to use interface, and great voice acting. You can also change it to text only if you are one who just wants to read it all.  Overall:  Primordia was a fun and enjoyable game. The story was a little slow in the beginning but picks up a little ways in. I laughed at times and even felt a little sad at times. It’s well worth playing if you enjoy point &amp; click adventure games or a good story and it won’t take you to long to beat.",1,0

365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"Tom Clancy's Destiny    tl;tr Conclusion  Recommended for casual RPG players who have friends on uPlay looking into a generic story with generic gameplay but overall a good time with the right people. Even if it's a generic story, I'm curious as to where this goes.   Not recommended for hardcore RPG and/or FPS players who don't have friends on uPlay who want originality and non-repetitive gameplay in a (everything is instanced) multiplayer.           Conclusion  I've been playing since Beta and not much has changed besides some really minor UI changes and nothing truly affecting the gameplay experience. I would've hoped for something more like DayZ where we can roam freely but that's a whole another level of complexity and possible failure open to interpretation and discussion. And in all honesty, game's alright. I guess agree to disagree, fight me.   Game might be worth 40 bucks for a lot of people, but the value of the game (in my opinion) is dependent on the amount of content provided. Multiplayer and single player is an option, the story that aimed for the hollywood-esque experience, the amount of tasks and side quests as if it were another Grand Theft Auto game or Elderscrolls game that forces you to stray from the main goals furthering your game time. It all really adds up in my book. Whether or not you decide to take advantage of all of those contents, even if they're lame, it's valued subjectively.    So what is it worth then?  I'd say 40 bucks, give or take. If you want gun-play, go Siege or Counterstrike. For multiplayer only games, they're worth 20-30 bucks in my opinion. Counterstrike more because you get more content from a variety of terrible to awesome level designers. Division would be worth 20 if it were multiplayer and darkzone only where everyone would have to fend for themselves. But I added the other 20 for the storytelling experience. I would add another 10-20 for the RPG elements, but it's not something I would brag about. Almost the same as Bioshock's RPG, the game was more heavily involved with the experience and the story than it was about the leveling and customization. While it still existed, it wasn't the game's strongest points.    Server Issues  I've seen some people rage pretty hard. I was pretty upset that I didn't get to play the first couple of times as I waited for the game to finally release, but hot damn. It's as if yourh'e screaming at your parents like children at the toy store impatiently for something that you absolutely can not wait for because you're dying of cancer within the next 24 hours and you have to get your game on. I suppose I saw this coming too when arguing the concepts of somewhat-massive multiplayer online first person shooters. It's hard to pull it off and to pull it off well in my opinion.    Are you experiencing any bugs?  Yeah. [s]Right now, I can't get sound to work properly with my speaker where music and sound effects play. Dialogue can only be heard if I absolutely turn it to my right or left speaker according the direction of the player. My headset works perfectly though. Set sound to speaker, cinematics audio will only play through headset and game sounds will play through speakers.[/s] Fix: Change your audio settings/configuration from Stereo to Mono or something else that doesn't utilize left and right speakers. In game audio isn't faint on one speaker, it just completely silences it out when your character faces a certain direction.  Before in Beta, if you can not shoot or click on anything, simply alt-tab out and alt-tab back in.  Black screen of death. I just had to restart my computer since I alt-tabbed out and force closed the application via Windows Task Manager when I was trying to fix my sound. I couldn't restart Steam either until I rebooted my desktop.    But I spent a hundred bucks  Get the refund. No more purchashing merchandise you don't want or are hyped about.    uPlay sucks  Get the refund. Don't purchase a game from ubisoft if you don't like them. You're kind of like the ex who's always trying to reason with why you want to go back. Then when you go back, you complain about the same things and break up again. Let it go.    What the ♥♥♥♥ do you know? You only played for [however many hours]! This game sucks balls! You suck balls! This is a ♥♥♥♥ review! uBi Fanboy! Lime in the coconut!  Take what you will from here. I got work in 5 hours.    You changed or added more to the review?  I'll do that. If I removed something, you will notice  words crossed out  usually because of an update. Otherwise, I just wanted to add more. Also, playing a news broadcasting station or a parody of news in the background seems to mix and match well (meant for dual or more monitors).   Pros  + Beautiful environment + Up to 4 player squads + Hard difficulty PvE modes/difficulty selection for missions, requires actual cooperation + Normal missions are harder with more friends + Missions are replayable + Headshots count for critial damage + Darkzone intense moments + Abilities and talents can change your fighting style + Story elements throughout the city + Random enemies spawn and events throughout the city from time to time + Voice comms in game are quite smooth in squad and in public + Upgradeable base of operations + Cover is unavoidable at times + Map Hologram with GPS for the ones with no sense of direction + Crafting supplies throughout the city + Interactive NPCs + Environmental destruction doesn't change up the gameplay + Bullet accuracy is good  + Dynamic lighting and shadows  + Allies become flagged so you can see them through walls, rogues become beacons + 3 types of scopes; ironsight, red dot, sniper scopes like acogs + Pistols or sidearms have unlimited ammo should you ever run out of anything else   Cons  - Macho and patriotic dialogue - Limited Customization - Limited Crafting - Limited Set of Skills - Not really an RPG - Once you go rogue, you can still be a good guy Agent afterwards... then go Rogue again for funsies.  - No true punishment or rating when it comes to going Rogue or really just dying - Characters and enemies all look the same, not so much diversity - Darkzone is not always intense or exciting, it just turns into team deathmatch or free for all majority of the time - Certain exploits; getting a drone to shoot you once or twice for owner to go rogue, getting someone to think you're a rogue by shooting them once in the foot forcing the other player to go rogue - You can roll your way out of almost anything...  - You can't Darkzone with your friends if you're one level apart - Sometimes you have to go all the way around a block or five as opposed to going through a building and into whatever backyard - There's hardly ever any squad commands or plays to be had, cooperative missions seems to be pointless if everyone pretty much just shoots in the same direction - Some players will lag in and out of the same area which is expected - Not exactly colorful game, but artistic direction and consistency I would argue for",1,1
203160,Tomb Raider,♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay of the 'cinematic' (i.e. linear and QTE heavy) variety. No real relation to the series as a whole other than the main character. You don't even raid any ♥♥♥♥ing tombs.  The 'open world' part of the game is a lie too as it's really highly linear. You can't even unlock new weapons out of order as certain necessary parts are only available in predetermined locations.,-1,1
206440,To the Moon,"I was SERIOUSLY put off by the RPGmaker graphics and gameplay, and all things considered, I still am. However, that is only because this game is such a fantastic experience, it's kind of a shame that you'd have to traverse such an emotionally exquisite story whilst also putting up with clunky controls and graphics that make it hard to discern items from eachother.  Nonetheless, the game does a fantastic job in its storytelling, managing to keep it light when it matters, foreshadow perfectly and hit you with emotional knockout blows that will have you taking deep breaths.  I really do consider this game, at this point, to be a must play. It's a perfect example on how gameplay can make an interactive story stand out even more, as you modify the artificial world around your actions, the pacing makes way for you to truly build a bond with the game, where everything is told either as a background prop, or a scene of dialogue going on in the background of a level.  I choose to shy away from expressing details in the story of the game because it's frankly better to play this game completely blindly, so if you haven't played the game yet, read no further and go get it.  Now, SPOILERS AHEAD WHERE I TALK ABOUT THE ENDING,   I was a bit disappointed by the ending. It's in no way a bad ending in terms of mood or writing, but I feel like it doesn't quite work along with the rest of the game. I understand the sole purpose of the game was to reach the big picture reached in the end, but I don't think it's a clever decision for the writer to do completely away with the elegant handling they did of River and John's relationship. There's a lot of loose ends that were burnt down instead of tied up, and it seemed like the instant the game revealed these loose ends, it just immediately did away with them. This bothered me, as it's never addressed directly how John and River complemented eachother. One of the images that struck me the most was that: He wanted to be unique like her, and she wanted to fit in -- in the end, he sought her out, and all she wanted was for him to remember.  It's a shame that they'd do away with that to tie it in with a happy ending. It's a good ending nonetheless, but it doesn't feel as equal payoff for the emotional commitment I had with the game's characters at the point of the stargazing scene.",1,0
317820,Guild of Dungeoneering Ultimate Edition,"I have a hard time calling this game a card game. For me I'd primarily call it a turn based rogue-lite (with a card style battle system). The RPG elements are fairly minimal as well. You can put on new equipment during a dungeon run, but that only gives you some extra cards, health, or a unique ability.   I really like the unlockable characters and their unique strategies. The game difficulty seemed to be just right for me as well. It took about 17 hours to finish the single player campaign, and I'm actually still wanting to play more so I bought the DLC right away.   The strategy can be fairly deep as well. Late in the game you can have quite a few active abilites. In my last game I had the following:  -Negate all damage if I'm only receiving 1.  -Deal 1 magic damage to the enemy if I receive 3 or more -Deal 1 damage if I can block all damage in 1 turn  The enemy also has quite a few unique abilites, so it's quite a bit to keep in mind as you make your moves.   All in all, this game has a lot of great elements. I'd mainly recommend it to people who like Rogue Legacy or FTL.",1,0

266840,Age of Mythology: Extended Edition,"First of all, I've never played AoM or AoE or anything like this before, neither any strategy game like this. A friend of mine wanted to buy it and asked me if I wanted to share the four pack. I agreed and plled two more friends in...   I loved playing Dota 2, but now, even when I miss racing around the map as Bloodseeker, I'm more willing to play AoM, because I loved it.   I always play with a friend of mine, one of the two I pulled in, and he had already played it long eons ago, so he taught me the basics and we play cooperatively, almost like one civilization with two players... except our civilizations are never the same.  For issues about connection, I admit there are some, but issues from Dota 2 are far worse than these, and mostly, I know it isn't the game's fault, but my friend's poor connection.  The only real problem is... this game is just a ilttle expensive.... just the price to eat for a month... depending on how much you eat of course.  So I suggest: put it on your wishlist and wait for steam's crazy discounts. The 4-pack we shared was for a bit more than $10.00 ... divided by four people. Plus, my share of the price was given as birthday gift.",1,0

331440,bit Dungeon II,"bit Dungeon II is a very short but fun game. You can beat it in two hours or less if you're not dum dum like me and *SPOILERS* you don't waste your ghost spirit while trying out the controls *END OF SPOILERS*. But if you are not an achievement maniac like me, then even while being a dum dum, you can beat it in 2 hours. When I understood that mashing space is your key to victory, everything became so easy... I killed the last boss in 2-3s. Which is awkward and I hope devs will fix all this.  Pros: - Zelda-like game with the elements of rogue-like games. - Several weapon types with lots of different stats, which do something and you kinda can see that with random numbers appearing. - No complex controls.  - Awesome boss music. Cons: - No map. I mean there is a mini-map, but the world is way bigger than that and it becomes hard to know where to go next. - Lots of different stats, but there are no explanations. So you don't know whether to get a weapon/armor or not. - Some mobs like knights are a huge pain in the ♥♥♥. They are harder than bosses. I hate them. - Damage between monsters varies too much - from scratching to 'omg where did my half of hp go?'.  To summarise, this game can be fun for those few hours and for 5 euros it is really worth it.",1,0

329050,Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition,"As someone who's played the ♥♥♥♥ out of the Devil May Cry games, I enjoyed what was all added here in the Special Edition. The three new characters are fun to play and are pretty unique from Dante and Nero, which was nice. Lady is probably my personal favorite of the added characters, with the focus on ranged combat feeling the most fresh gameplay wise. The new game modes are also welcome, providing additional challenges for experienced players. All the characters also have a bunch of costumes to unlock, which is always fun. I was a bit disappointed that the new characters didn't get their own music or separate set of levels, but I can't complain too much in light of everything they did add.  On the technical side of things, the game is pretty well optimized. It runs at a solid 60fps fairly reliably, it never seemed to drop below that even with a ton of enemies on screen at once. Graphically the game looks pretty great, although I'm not sure what was all 'enhanced' specifically. Granted, it has been quite a while since I played the original version, so I may have just simply forgotten what it used to look like.  Overall it's a great game, I had a lot of fun coming back to it. Gameplay wise its one of the most refined and solid action games I've played, and it still holds up pretty well. With the added features you get a pretty good amount of content for the price (five characters, seven difficulty modes, and bloody palace) compared to most similar games. If you're a newcomer to the series it's not a bad place to start either, since none of the games are strongly tied to each other. Highly recommended.",1,0

I would start the game determined that if I just made the right choices, my love would take me back. Only to feel the crushing disappointment at the end, and then feel it again.

429620,Dungeon Rushers,"A cute D&amp;D inspired dungeon-crawling RPG with the kind of mildly amusing, quirky humour where you probably wouldn't laugh out loud but instead, at the very most, exhale forcefully through your nose. Maaaybe.  You click around or use your arrow keys to move around a tile-style dungeon, revealing more of the map as you go. Event-tiles scatter throughout the halls somewhat randomly and activate upon contact. There's a bit of a hassle in that when you're moving you can only reveal the tile you're on, and not the tiles around you, so you're often bumping into monsters and traps before you can make plans to evade them. Thankfully your party posseses various skills, which cost stamina, that allow you to reveal certain tiles if you don't feel like running in blind. This can be very useful if you're running low on health and looking to avoid unnecessary confrontations. Battles are turn-based and to be honest, very simple. I haven't felt challenged so far, even when playing the 'Heroic Mode' dungeons, but hopefully that will change as I move further into the game.  You'll find gold, salvage loots, craft gear, as well as level up and unlock skills and abilities. It's all very standard.  There IS a dungeon building aspect to this game, which I touched on very briefly, but not enough to really comment on at this stage. It's very easy to set the tiles and add monsters and traps so at a glance it look pretty solid... You can take that as you will. I haven't even touched the PVP yet though.  By the way, you might be under the impression that you can create and customize your characters to your personal tastes but this is actually not the case. There is a preset story with already-made characters that unlock the further you progress into the game. This isn't inherently a bad thing, rather think of it as a heads up if you happen to have made the same assumptions as I did.  Overall, I don't think you'd find anything new or groundbreaking here but it's still a nifty, little dungeon-crawler. Generally fun for those who are already into this type of game but it probably won't win anyone over. I'd say a 5/10, still recommendable.",1,0

With the vast majority of the playerbase in the 'endgame' or near it, new players might find it a little frustrating to get started, and may be a big turnoff to those just seeing what this game's all about.  I'm sure there will be some sort of handicap put into place to assist new players in actually getting far enough into the game to appreciate all the customization and combat mechanics, but today is not that day.  If you have some spare change, I highly suggest saving up for some of the plantinum deals youc an get through daily log-ins, but real money purchases are by no-means necessary to make it to the higher eschelons of the playerbase, I know from experience.  7.5/10, would, and have recommended.",1,0

3980,CivCity: Rome,I'm sorry but this game is really poor. Firstly it shamelessly rips off the Caesar series of games. Secondy it's not as good. I'd hoped to see something soecial from this game which is a decade more recent (or thereabouts) from the 1st Caesar but the graphics are very disappointing and there's some sort of bug which means your workers won't do their jobs. Which means that even with two fire stations fires totally destroyed my second city whilst the firemen did nothing.

It is a nice feeling to feel that danger until you can at least say 'good, I'm strong enough now'. That's one of the feeling I liked in this game, as well as discovering the factions, the units, the different gameplays, and also exploring each different plane along my various games.

Obviously the graphics and engine are a big improvement from the first one, also the combat feels better. Honestly I feel like the combat in this reminds me a lot of the combat in Dark Souls, it is also just as deadly. If that is one thing I can impart that feels the most different from the first game it's that in the first game it isn't too uncommon to be fighting 6-8 monsters sometimes at once, and not really even break a sweat, not so in 2, you really need to pay attention, and use that dodge and parry and your aards. Treat every combat as if you could die easily in it, because you probably will.  Also you can no longer drink potions during combat, you have to prepare for battles by drinking potions only when you are meditating, on the plus side, as long as you are not in combat it seems you can meditate anywhere, and do not need a fire. All in all The Witcher 2 pretty much improves on all aspects of The Witcher 1.   Just one thing: skip the tutorial, it is awful.",1,0

Bar GTA V, this is the best small Multiplayer game Ive played in ages. Infact last time I had this much fun was playing time splitters future perfect.   I've played mainly survival, but much prefer the conquest mode.   The support class I reckon could do with a shift around.  Haven't tried the recon yet,   The assault class, is amazing and quite op with the jet pack. Not to mention I seem to rack up vast amounts of credits really quickly with this class.  The dinosaurs are great, at first I jumped on the rocks and just picked off the raptors. The larger raptors can still spit poison at you, the t-rex can lob a boulder at you, pterodactyls can pick you up and some cases the tricertops can ram the rock sending you flying. So you can't abuse that mechanic.   The vehicles are awesome, still haven't tried all of them, but again ideal, not over powered. Go on I dare you to take a tricertops on in a 4 by 4 :p  I'd give this a easy 8/10, losing one mark because in some games I get kicked out for no reason on the start (trolls most likely) and the other mark, you just can't make a perfect game :p  10/10 for a time waster though",1,0

244090,Sid Meier's Ace Patrol: Pacific Skies,"Note: Summary at the bottom of the review.  The second 'Ace Patrol' game, 'Pacific Skies' is a turn-based strategy (TBS) game that is small in scope, simple, yet very engaging and nice to pick up and play for a bit. There really aren't that many historical air combat TBS games out there, so it is hard to compare it to anything else. It feels a bit like a smartphone-port, yet the controls work well so I cannot really say that this is a drawback in itself. The game IS casual, so do not expect it to have overly much complexity to it. The core of the game is assigning different maneuvers to your pilot(s), trying to put them in the best position to shoot down the enemy. As you progress, you unlock new maneuvers and gain new planes and improvements.  Pro: *Simple, engaging pick-up-and-play gameplay. *Both sides are balanced the same. *Has a certain charm to its style.  Con: *Not that much depth to it.  Summary: A fun little TBS game that will cater to your desire for a casual TBS experience, Ace Patrol: Pacific Skies is worth its pricetag so long as you do not expect anything with too much depth and complexity to it. 6/10 - Recommended.

Technical Issues: NONE if you want to run this game properly without crashes look at the game requirements instead of just purchasing the game because you got a new computer this game fully maxes out my new computer which i spent more than 1 grand on (ps they do lie a little bit about recomending 3.5ghz on the processor i have 3.4 and i run it on ultra so if you're planning on buying this game shortly after buying a new pc keep that in mind that you dont have to spend an extra 50 dollars or so) If you found dark souls too difficult but liked the gameplay when it worked this is the game for you.",1,0

I'm not generally a turn based tactics aficionado, but I found the combat both entertaining and challenging. The mechanics are straightforward to grasp (and the tutorial information is good), and combine to enable complex tactical scenarios. Constant thought and attention are mandatory, and mindless play will result in a solid beatdown. I expected to be bored after the first few battles, and instead I'm starting another playthrough to snag some more achievements.  The art is lovingly crafted throughout, and the narrative engaging. I found it difficult to stop playing, and the urge to win one more battle was ever present.  Recommended.",1,0

300080,Total War Battles: KINGDOM,"In short:  I like the game, it has lots of potential .. but it's an ill conceived cash cow that will milk you dry.  Things that ruin this game:  * Increadibly long periods of time to do even the most menial tasks. This is a game where you click and then walk away for a day, a week .. half a month (Yes, chop down and tree and it will take half a month real time to grow back). * No auto activity feature .. forcing you to micro manage even the most basic resource collection (see previous point). * Huge reliance on gold to speed things up (purchased with real coin) to make this game even playable (see previous point). * Increadible difficulting in raising gold through the actual game (see previous point).   So unless you fork out huge amounts of real cash, be prepared to wait until retirement before anything exciting happens.",-1,1

I keep coming back is because there are so many things to do, with single player you can do story (It's pretty ok but not best with annoying scanning), build a city mess around with mods and more. On muiltplayer, I recommend the ilovebacons server or just starting up a single player and invite your friends, Meet people (like my good friend RollyButters, say I said hes a great guy!), Role play or even do some pvp/arenas if you want to. My point is every time I play I find something new to do. It's a lot like Terriaria but with space travel, story and easier building.

Honestly it's one of those games where you play from anywhere to 1-4 hours then you come back (usually at the end of the day or etc) and do the same. This is NOT game that you can just play 24/7 (unless yo pay cash) due to the 'food' resource which is what you spend to play.

200510,XCOM: Enemy Unknown,"Over 150 hours in and, finally, I beat the game (on easy).  This game affects me the same way Civilization does. I get really into it for an all day session but then I'm not able to come back for a while. By the time I boot up again, I forgot what I was doing, I realize I don't care about these soldiers anymore (wait,did I make the Heavy class have blue hair or was that the Assualts?), and I decide I better just start over again. Anyway this time I'll do better cause I'll remember to build a satellite nexus (and not just the satellites - doh!).  And I LOVE IT.   It's not without fault; software bugs abound, the UI is mildly annoying, descriptions feel hidden. But it's a fantastic theme wrapped around a much more than 'decent' squad progression system with a min/max resource managment side (with is completely engrossing at times).   I got tense during a few firefights when I had to make the choice between putting my badass vet into a BAD situation (potentially squandering the 20+ missions worth of development he had) or withdrawing and letting the aliens take those hostages (we miss you Dice - you RapTapBang'd with the best).

254960,Silent Storm,"Silent Storm started out as an interesting tactical squad game that ended as a real disappointment for me. Initially, the character customization, range of classes, and diversity of weapons and equipment seemed to reveal a great deal of complexity in the game. Which to me looked like a lot of fun, or at least that’s what I thought…  Gameplay is pretty similar to the older XCOM or Jagged Alliance games so if you’re familiar with either of those you’ll pick up the basics really quickly. The voice acting is pretty silly and the overall story for why you are involved at all is pretty minimal.  After about 5-6 missions I realized that realistically, the only classes worth using were sniper, soldier, and scout (engineer and medic are both broken and useless as of patch 1.2) and anything except for single shot rifles and ‘secret’ weapons was totally useless in combat. The enemy AI has a habit of doing really weird things like crouching in high places and forcing you to start combat, but never leaving to engage you.  If that wasn’t bad enough, the way the game gets you to the next mission requires that you find special clues in each mission. So if you don’t find the right clues you’ll end up like I did, stuck at a mission where I was totally overwhelmed by a sudden special enemy (Panzerklein) against which _none_ of my weapons worked. After experimenting with different approaches over an hour or two, including stealing some special weapons mid-battle, I managed to defeat the enemies…except the game announced a self-destruct sequence that I had no chance of avoiding or overriding.   I decided to throw in the towel after that. I had already rerolled once before just to try out different classes and weapons and by this point the game was getting really tedious and unrewarding. It’s just not worth the self-punishment when there are better squad strategy games out there.",-1,0

247080,Crypt of the NecroDancer,This game manages to put the most ingenious mechanic into play in such a fun way.

362960,Tyranny,"If you liked Pillars of Eternity, you will like this. It has a lot of the same strengths and weaknesses as PoE, with a few notable changes: 1. More meaningful choices encourage multiple playthroughs. It's nothing as significant as Witcher 2, but it definitely has enough 'haha, well that was different' moments to justify a 2nd playthrough. 2. Short, which actually works well with #1. 25-30ish hours. 3. Classless, use-skills-to-improve-them style leveling which encourages hybrid builds. 4. Unconventional, early iron age psuedo-Roman-conquest setting.  If you haven't played PoE and are on the fence, wait for a sale and try that first. If you have, you probably already know what you're getting into. This kind of game is not everyone's cup of tea, and it has just enough in common with the old Baldur's Gate-style games to ♥♥♥♥ off the purists while scaring away anyone who hates reading dialogue.   This isn't an 80 hour remake of Baldur's Gate or Pillars of Eternity 2. I suspect many bad review came from people who just didn't know what they were getting into.",1,0

The control scheme takes a while to get used to, and at times the servers are lagging so bad that it is virtually unplayable.  Visuals are nicely done, but unfortunately it left a strong taste of P2W. While you can exchange the primary ingame currency to 'gold' for the cash shop, this would take an outrageous amount of time, in the ballpark of say two weeks farming for a paintjob on one of your ships.  Prices in the cash ship do not appear to be outrageous though, so if you are prepared to spend some cash on this game, it could be fun.",1,0
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"A lot of the economy and family management that was in Attila has been removed. However, a new RPG style system for your generals and agents (now called lords and heroes) has replaced it and is a lot better than before. Your characters start with the bare minimum and as the game progresses you can equip them with powerful equipment, spells and unit buffs. The game is less focused on settlement management than previous games and rewards you mostly for fighting and winning battles with money and upgrades for your generals. This may sound like a downgrade but actually skimming out the features of the old games that didn't quite work to the standard games like Crusader Kings and Europa Universalis do, have left it with a game that is all about the huge battles with giant units.   This is the best Total War for a long time. I recommend the Chaos campaign aswell, shame it was not included in the game and was pre-order DLC.",1,0
322300,The Repopulation,Early Access Review,1,0
233250,Planetary Annihilation,"My favorite thing about this game is either the spherical battlefields or the Shared Army feature. Spherical battlefields gives you lots of options for attacking. With good scouting, you can almost always find a weak point in their base, or some undefended fabbers or metal extractors somewhere. Shared Army is an option you can turn on in team games. It makes your entire team share command of all units and economy. Basically it's like you are all part of a single army, as opposed to traditional multiplayer where you are all separate armies but allied. Shared Army really forces you to work together. If one person is playing poorly and taxing your economy, it hurts everyone. So you have to communicate until everyone is on the same page. If you're good you will each choose complimentary roles, like 'Production', 'Metal acquisition', 'Commanding the army', 'Expanding to other planets', etc.   Play this game for a more complex, less constricted RTS. And don't worry about any of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you have to deal with in Starcraft 2. 'Production rounds'? Dear god. In PA, tell your factory you want it to produce two tanks and one inferno, and set it to infinite loop, and it will produce units until it is destroyed or you win.

The art Direction of this game is true to the original movie, as well as the gameplay.

The only things keeping it from being a 10/10 are some annoying pathing issues, you basically have to micro manage everything for your party members to be able to move past/around each other.  Also, the companions you find are seriously lacking in personality compared to Baldur's gate 1/2.

HELL YEAH! :)  This one is quite old but still kickin!  So what do we do in Evil Genius? First of all WE ARE Evil Genius! So we plot to rule the world and get rid of those pesky agents. First of all we must build our underground lair! Is that cool or what? Then we need to recruit some faithfull minions. Yes! We are head of evil organisation so we need someone to do a dirty work for us. Then we got a lot of objectives to accomplish- from kidnapping, to stealing art, building secret super weapons... name it.  Yeah- graphic is old, but still good. Game has tons of humor. Music &amp; sounds are great. This is fun, good game.  If you like spy movies and games like dungeon keeper- BUY IT.",1,0

105600,Terraria,"Nominated for the 'TEST OF TIME' Award.  TL;DR: Terraria is what many sandbox games want to be. BUY IT (and if possible; tell your friends)!  Terraria is a well known and much appreciated friend. Maybe you lost contact with it a long time ago but once you two meet again, you immediately hug each other and realize you missed each other quite alot the whole time. Maybe you spend some time together, see how much you changed (there are still coming updates and patches for this old buddy!) over time - but mostly for the best. Maybe you two part again but you already know - you will keep Terraria in your heart and know that it will be there for you.  It is a game you can always pick up and spend hours in. Randomly generated maps, immense content, you know a sandbox game if you see one. You pick your own goals and this isn't restricted on solo games - play it with your friends or strangers you know for few minutes over the internet! The graphics, as you can see, is pixelart so if you don't like it, I won't judge you but don't always judge a book by it's cover - give it a shot. It's not like other sandbox games in 3-D but that isn't a bad thing either.",1,0

227300,Euro Truck Simulator 2,"A worthy game of driving and driving and driving and driving and driving. It's not for the 'let's go 200 mph like every NFS copy in the world' kind of game. It's meant to role play really being a trucker. It's quite relaxing and very enjoyable as a diversion title. Graphics are decent, a little washed out due to HDR (similar to ENB series), sounds are, OK, the music capability with live radio implementation should be in every game ever made, ever. Physics may not be full blown simulation, but they do a good job overall and you can feel the weight you carry. The idea of the ticket system is a bit of the low point, it's not bad, messed up, or buggy; it's just annoying sometimes. The AI is quite good for a street driving system, yet still occasionally pulls a stupid maneuver, and even suicidal behavior at times. Damage system is great, though not as cosmetic as it is physical. Damaging the air brakes requires you to let the truck warm up so that the air pressure will build, and every cockpit gauge works accordingly (quite rare in any driving game). Plenty of my friends will say something like - upon showing them this game - essentially: 'I EXPECT to go 150 mph through traffic in 2 seconds while on fire' and my response is 'go play need for speed, kid.' It's a different kind of game, one where you immerse yourself for hours and relax to the lines of the road. Not for super speed and nitro buttons. for the current and often sales, it's worth every penny for someone who likes just plain driving. 8/10.",1,0

There is a lot of humor and drama that may bring tears to your eyes, you will feel emotional just like i did, every step you take you will want to know more about the story, about the characters because there is so much depth in this game than in any other games i have played.  The soundtrack they used during the game matches the scenes and is very powerful in creating the atmosphere, the tensions and the emotions.

The guys who made this made a few other games, too. Castle Crashers, (I think - it's what I've heard.), Aether, and Super Meat Boy. There are probably a few others.  also, Steam buyers would likely get a discount on the remake - being released this year - if they buy this (the original!) before the release of the remake - Edmund M is trying to find a way to make sure that happens.  The game is, as previously said, difficult - expect to die a fair few times on earlier floors, before beating them.  The fun, however, lies in the luck-based gameplay.

When you line it up next to titles of the same release time then you notice quite how behind they are.  Gameplay: Gameplay wise, it's the same as the COD before it and the one before that. They make some new maps, throw in some new perks and guns and call it a new game. Sadly this isn't how it works, each year it feels the same now. The network code is still suffering heavily and sadly this effects the enjoyment of the game.  Conclusion: In conclusion, the series is dying now being kept afloat by frat boys and casual gamers but for anyone looking for a real challenge or game of skill then this isn't it. They have taken a once amazing series and turned it into a cash cow.",-1,0

49520,Borderlands 2,"I've loved every hour and kill in this game.  Borderlands 2, obvious sequel to ''Borderlands'' is honestly one of my favorite games ever (and i'm a pretty hardcore gamer myself). This is a fantastic blend between RPG and FPS. In a vast and amazing open world approprietly named ''Pandora''. Every meter of this game has so much to offer, so many guns (87 Bazillion!), so many locations and so many enemies. Borderlands 2 is a never ending experience with lots of fun.  The Hyperion Corporation desires to obtain the Vault Key to awaken ''The Warrior'' for mass extinction. And it's leader, Handsome Jack, will do anything to make this happen. Your job is to make your way through and stop this from happening. While doing this, you have tons of side quests, you'll meet tons of old friends and find lots of easter eggs and references.   Factions:  The Bandits will be your main annoyance. As generic bandits, they'll give you a struggle throughout the game. They don't care about no ''Vault Key'', pssshhhh, they just wanna see some blood! Nomads, Psychos, Marauders, Midgets, Rats, Goliaths and Bruisers are what define Borderlands as a whole and if Borderlands 3 is a thing, they will undoubtedly appear and cast the same fame.  Hyperion Corporation is the strongest faction, the so-to-speak leaders of Pandora. With Engineers, Loaders, Constructors and Soldiers, Hyperion will give you one hell of a bad time if you do not have the appropiate weapons and level.   Crimson Raiders are who you work for. Lead by the main cast of the first Borderlands, Roland, Lilith, Mordecai and Brick. The Crimson Raiders are who want to stop Jack. On here, no one ever does anything except you. So essentially you are your own faction to stop it all.  And obviously, Wildlife. There are too many iterations of these to write them all. The Wildlife can be seen in almost every location. Spiderants, Varkids, Crystalisks, Threshers etc. These are particularly the main annoyance, at least for me. You'll encounter them almost anywhere that's not Hyperion terretory.   Those are all the Factions. What else is there?   Leveling up: The game consists on an XP system that depending on your level and the enemy's, you'll get rewarded with a certain amount of XP once they die. There are also other ways to get XP: Completing missions, completing long term accomplishments (open 5000 boxes, pick up 750 weapons etc.) XP and levelling up is what makes the game unique and hard to an extent.  Guns: Borderlands 2 uses a similar Item randomization like Diablo III. In Borderlands 2, there are aproximately 17,000,000 different types of weapons. They all can vary in: Scope, Type of bulets, Type of Melee, Rarity, Firing Rate, Accuracy, Recoil, Reticle etc. The probability of you finding the same gun twice is pretty damn small.  Rarity: There are 5 different types of rarity: White, Green, Blue, Purple, Orange. White being least rare and Orange being rarest. These can all vary between guns, grenade mods, shields, class mods, relics, heads and skins. However these do depend on level, for example: A level 1 orange is a lot worse than a level 50 white. Rarity in Borderlands 2 makes Farming a big role in the game. If you wanna get better stuff you better get used to doing stuff like this. Farming can be: Killing a boss, saving and quitting and doing it again until you have something you like, this can also be done with a chest. Everytime you save and quit chests and enemies go back to their original state.  Side Quests: Quests are essentially what make up the game. But I mean side quests. Side quests help you level up faster, get better stuff and know more about the game. You may ignore these, but that's not very smart and could make your Borderlands experience awfully slow an painful. Side Quests are just as importat as Main Story missions.  There is much more to offer, but i've got only so many characters left. I hope you've enjoyed this giant and rather small summarize of the game. Borderlands 2 has much more to offer! Please consider buying Borderlands 2.   -Robz",1,0

OH WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥' You died, lol get rekt. Killed by: Magma Worm  'Come on, I'm doing so well this time, I finally got the magma worm and NOOOO' Remember your use items. Killed by: Wandering Vagrant --  'Risk of Rain,' also known as 'Risk of Buttclench' and 'Ragequit Simulator 2015' is a permadeath sidescrolling shooter with decent controls and a constantly stable 60 FPS, two essentials for a roguelike.  In it, you play as a guy who just crashlanded on a planet. You have to find the teleporter on the map (it moves around each session), activate it, survive for 90 seconds, and clear off any remaining enemies before you go to the next area. Here's the catch: the game slowly increases in difficulty the longer you're on a level and doesn't reset, meaning you might see things as easy when you're in beginner-level difficulty but the longer you take to complete the level, the harder the enemies will be, so it might all be fun around Very Easy, but ♥♥♥♥ gets sour around Easy and if you reach Medium or higher before you've at least found and started the second teleporter... may God have mercy on your soul.  The maps themselves won't change much. It's alright, though, because the teleporter can be anywhere on it, they're huge, and the game cycles between different sets of maps with around 10 in total across 4 tiers (plus UES Contact Light), so it doesn't really get old. It's also got good netcoding for co-op, so you can bring along a friend without any out-of-sync issues.  Overall: 9/10. $10? Worth it. $2.50? Get it, or you're just stupid.",1,0

440630,The Brookhaven Experiment,"Unfortunately, I was out of town on vacation when this game released, so I didn't get to play it until last night. Overall, it is a great game, and well worth the price.  The campaign lasted about 3.5 hours. While it would be nice if it was longer, I do think it was long enough and I haven't even jumped into survival mode yet.   -Pros *Good Campaign, and relatively long for VR. *Great Atmosphere. It was dark and the enemies always had multiple vectors of attack. *Excellent Pace. I love pace at which the difficulty increases. No offense to Raw Data, but this is how it's done! *The Shotgun!  -Cons *Sound. It still seems like it's difficult to gauge how far away enemies are based on sounds. *Consumables. The flares were too few and far between. All other consumables were too difficult to use. I died whenever I tried, as throwing them seems to have a bit of a learning curve. *Spiders!  -Additional *Switching weapons. Switching to consumables and back to your gun is too difficult to do during frantic situations. Unfortunately, I can't think of a more intuitive way to do this. So I'll blame this one on the hardware and not the software. *Location of Crates. The crates (unlockables) which are scattered throughout the campaign are sometimes in locations which cannot easily be made out in the HMD. Although, watching the same scene on my stream I can easily make it out. This is due to the fact that peripheral view is blurry or distorted in the HMD. So this can also be attributed to hardware and not software.  Overall, I have no problem recommending this game to others. I think I'll spend a lot more time in this one!",1,0

236470,NA,"I'm a big fan of Pac-Man, but this collection left a bad taste in my mouth.  I realized before I purchased this that Ms. Pac-Man was DLC, and I thought that was a cheap trick to get more money, but I knew what I was getting into and I thought the price was still fair. If you're a big Pac-Man fan, the bundle is a good deal. Some games will likely never be played by me, but some games ( the original game and Ms. Pac Man) will be played quite a bit. A big down side for me was that I can't figure out how to get 2 player on Ms. Pac Man...which is really frustrating.  Unfortunately, I didn't research as much as I should have. What really sold me on getting this was having Pac-Man Championship Edition and Battle Royale included. I got CE for free on my PS3 a few years ago and loved it, but I sold my PS3 and I was excited to play it again at a fair price. I didn't realize that what I had on PS3 was the DX+ version of the game, and the version included is nowhere near as fun. Even if an upgrade was offered as DLC, I would be okay with that, but it is not. Battle Royale is frstrating in a completely different way because they took a HD game and put a border around the entire screen.  Just..why?   Bottom line, the package is alright, but it lacks the option to change resolution and the thick borders (particularly on BR) is unnecessary. If you can get it for $5 you probably will get your money's worth, but supporting such a lazy port feels wrong to me. I wish I could get my money back.",-1,0

201790,Orcs Must Die! 2,"This is a long review so if you just want a brief summary of why I recommend Orcs Must Die! 2 then skip to  Results  and read from there.   Robot Entertainment makes a fantastic addition to their brilliant tower defense game. Orcs Must Die! 2 adds new elements of gameplay to the tower defense genre by mixing FPS, TD, and RPG games.   Story:  The War Mage has seals the final rift taking magic away from the world, but forever protecting it from the orcs continually onslaught. The world begins to crumble as magic no longer influences the weather i, sickness, and food. People are realizing the harsh world that they inhabit as magic is taken away. The Sorceress no longer has the ability to control the hordes of orcs, as her magic is gone and she has not long to live before they finally dispose of her. But The Master with his last fleeting breath hopes to give the kingdom one last chance opens a rift bringing back The Sorceress. The Master hopes The Sorceress will learn from her mistake and join The War Mage to restore the Order and bring back magic to the world again.    Campaign:  Orc Must Die! 2 offers two acts, the first consist of seven levels and the second of eight. They start out with each level only being a few waves, and then gradually increasing till you get to the last level which is about twelve waves. Similar to the original you cannot save half way into a level, meaning you need to make sure you have the time available to beat a level before you start it. The game also offers Endless Mode, which includes a variety of levels, some seen in the campaign and others that are unique. Endless mode allows you to obtain skulls (the currency used to buy upgrades) while at the same time getting to practice strategies. The campaign is played similar to the first one where you must place towers to defend rifts from being attacked, but incorporates more RPG elements. If you own Orcs Must Die! the original, you will also be given ten special levels in classic mode. Classic mode essentially is the best parts of the original campaign that can be played co-op and with the new features. This also allows you to earn more skulls and develop your character.    Gameplay:  Orcs Must Die! 2 allows you to play as one of two characters: The Sorceress and The War Mage. The War Mage has higher health while The Sorceress offers more mana. As such one is focused more around using melee and non-magic weapons and the other is based more on magic and spell-casting. This allows you to change how you will play right from the start of the campaign. Unlike Orcs Must Die! you can no longer upgrade your character with coins through the weavers. Instead you buy trinkets using skulls that offer your character passive abilities, upgrade your towers with skulls and unlock unique abilities for the towers, and upgrade weapons with skulls. Each level allows you to get five skulls, plus any additional bonus skulls you pick up as result of enemy drops. This gameplay is focused much more on RPG style gameplay and beating the campaign on War Mage with 5 skulls for every level is near impossible if you don’t grind yourself up in Endless Mode.   Multiplayer:  Orcs Must Die! 2 offers multiplayer, finally you can play co-op as one player is The Sorceress and the other is The War Mage. I personally never played multiplayer, but its nearly self-explanatory that this adds all new elements to the game. A lot of the levels seem as though they are designed for two players, requiring you to essentially run from one side of the map to the other during waves. Adding multiplayer takes Orcs Must Die! and combines it with Sanctum taking the best from both worlds.     Fire and Water:  The first DLC pack for Orcs Must Die! 2. The levels include new levels (Traffic Jammed, Double Decker, and The West Wing), new enemies (Fire and Water Lords), and new traps (Web Spinner, Dart Spitters, and Floor Portal). Double Decker is one of my favorite levels; it is a two pathed level where you get to use minecarts to stop your foes. The new enemies Fire and Water Lords offer all new challenges, if you don’t kill them quick enough they evolve. They can evolve two times starting at Firelings and becoming Fire Lords. The Fire Lords are similar to Ogres and have a lot of health while the Firelings are like Orcs. I personally liked the Dart Spitters came in handy on levels where I wanted to concentrate traps, but ran out of space.    Family Ties:  This DLC further expands Orc Must Die! 2 offering loads of new content: three new levels, two new weapons, a new trinket, and even some new enemies. The levels include: Rush Hour, Breakneck Triad, and Triple Threat. The new levels are really well designed and can be played easily solo or with a group. One of the new weapons, Stone Staff, was actually my favorite weapon as it allows you to essentially freeze enemies then do increased damage to them. The Hobgoblin Healer is a very good addition and requires you to focus your strategy differently as they can cause a simple attach to be very difficult. The Ball and Chain is essentially just a stronger Ogre. Overall this is a great addition to the game, and the new weapon in my opinion is the best in the game.    Are We There Yeti?:  This is another exciting DLC pack offered with Orcs Must Die! 2. The pack includes three levels: Yeti Den, The Hive, and Chilled Cavern. These levels introduce new characters (Yeti and Goblin Sapper) and offer a new weapon/trap/trinket. In my opinion these new levels are the hardest ones I’ve played in the Orcs Must Dies series, specifically “Yeti Den”. I played the levels on War Mage and beat them solo, but definitely could not do that on Nightmare. The levels are set up to be played with multiple people and this pack would probably be a lot more entertaining on multiplayer.   Results:  Orcs Must Die! 2 is a fantastic game that combines RPG, FPS, and TD into one single game. With co-op play you can mess around with your friends and play the maps to a whole new level. Orcs Must Die! 2 also integrate Orcs Must Die! campaign into the game (if you own the latter) allowing you to play the original levels with the new elements of the Orcs Must Die! 2. There are way more weapons to mess around with, loads more spells, trinkets, and special tower upgrades making Orcs Must Die! 2 a great addition to the first game. With loads of DLC to add to it this game is a must buy. If you are unsure or maybe just frugal, such as myself, then wait till the complete pack is on sale and grab that. As you will want to buy the DLC once you really get into the game.   Pros: +A campaign consisting of 15 new levels +Addition of endless mode that lets you go nuts. +Loads of new baddies (including the Orc Mages and Shaman from Orcs Must Die! DLC) +Co-Op play so you can mess around with a friend and have a great new experience +Incorporating RPG elements to the game +Three DLC packs +If you own the original you get Classic mode which includes ten levels from Orcs Must Die! +Loads of new spells (including spells from Orcs Must Die! DLC) +Loads of new towers (offering different play strategies) +Trinkets (which give you passive and active abilities) +Character customization with new costumes. +The story picks up right where it left off. +Two heroes which allow you to choose your play-style.  +They added weekly challenges, which get you to play maps in order to earn extra skulls. +You can refund your skulls without any penalties as many times as you want.   Cons: -Orcs Must Die! 2 seems to focus too much on grinding. (in order to beat the Campaign on War Mage you essentially need to play Endless mode to get skulls) -The guardian limit is still incredibly low. -There are no levels that corridor enemies so you can just build one long defensive run and have fun with the game.",1,0

If ever there was a game to really push yourself into, this is it. This is about as close as a game gets to a RW emulation of war and combat. It gives you the feel of long, boring, drawn out situations (like being on guard, walking a patrol, or riding in a convoy), punctuated with moments of dire intensity. If you're on the fence about Arma 3, start with the original game (arma / operation flashpoint) or arma 2 (which is almost perpetually on sale) and see how you feel about them first.   This game is NOT for everyone, but as an actual soldier who has experienced a combat deployment, I give this my recommendation.",1,0

364390,Downfall,"Внизу будет обзор на русском.  Thanks for this great remake! After playing Cat Lady I tried original Downfall, but it was too raw for me. But this one is really awesome.  If you've played Cat Lady already, then I assure you - this game is really similar. Most of the cons and pros are same here.  Pros: - Really unique style - Great story pacing and action feedback. There almost always will be something new and intriguing. - Story is interesting and captivating (upon completing the game I still can't throw it outta my head) - Simple but still immersive controls - Awesome soundtrack  Cool but flawed: - I really like the voice acting. Some people arguing to low quality through but I almost didn't notice that. Still emotions and act are quite impressive for me - Horror component. OK this one is tricky. I know many people like the darkness and grimness of Harvester Games, so sorry no offence. Horror is really harsh, shocking and you will definitely remember that. That itself is cool for me. What I didn't like is really high amount of meat&amp;rot&amp;maggots disgusting themes which are over the line. In my opinion, there are more elegant ways to scare and shock player, and what game often use these ways. It's a mash of exquisite horror style and then lots of raw meat. Also, sometimes horror sequences really don't look like natural part of the whole game. They are here as if author like them but didn't really though about integrating them into the main story. IMO, again. - Graphics. It's really amazing what R Michalski managed to do with good old AGS engine. His artistic skills and choices can bewitch. And rough animations somehow comeplement choisen style. Still, it's not 3D AAA and pretty budget, and animations are still rough. I would really like to see Downfall and Among the sleep graphic decisions combined together.  OK, that were cons actually for some people. Don't play if you have overly sensitive sense of hearing. Don't play if you are pregnant/traumatic/healthy american dream/else. It's pretty sick game despite leaning majorly on some cool things like love, hope, courage. The ending will kill you certainly for ceveral days at least. Don't play if you are sensitive to resolution/ PC MASTER RACE.  and another cons: - Play Cat Lady first, or you won't get ending at all. These games have lots of intersections. Probably to understand more you have to complete original Downfall: A Horror Adventure Game first, but I'm too not-oldschool for dat.  If I'd be a reviewer on IGN or something, my evaluation for this game would be 7.5/10 But the impact of this game upon me worth solid A. Without plus but really solid. As I've said already, can't throw this game outta my head since completing.  Waiting for the next R Michalski's game.    ------------------------------ Для тех, кто не дуплит по-английски. Не знаю, зачем вам эта игра, ведь русского в ней нет, а если и будет, то дай бог не чтобы такой, как в Cat Lady в Стиме (машинный), а такой, как у Акеллы в Кошатнице. На случай, если перевод таки будет и он будет норм, мой обзор на русском.   Спасибо разрабам за офигенный ремейк! После Кошатницы я пытался поиграть в предыдущую игру того же автора, ремейк которой мы наблюдаем, Downfall: A Horror Adventure Game. Не зашло. А вот ремейк охрененен.  Если вы играли в Кошатницу, то тут практически всё то же самое, за исключением акцентов в истории. Если нет, то эти плюсы и минусы для Кошатницы тоже подойдут.   Плюсы: - Охрененный ни на что не похожий стиль - История постоянно развивается, продолжается и не даёт скучать, почти постоянно что-то происходит. - История очень интересная и сильно цепляет (как и с Кошатницей, очень сложно выбросить из головы еще долгое время после прохождения) - Простые, но при этом отлично справляющиеся с погружением игрока в игру кнопки управления. Нафиг point&amp;click, без него здесь лучше - Невероятный саундрек   Как бы и минусы, и как бы плюсы: - Озвучка мне правда понравилась. Некоторые жалуются, что звучит будто запись в туалете, но я почти не заметил несовершенства самой записи, но что заметил - актеры хорошо справляются с эмоциями и заставляют верить. Это ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ главное в инди адвенчуре - Хоррорная составляющая. Фанаты закидают меня своими фанатскими гуанами, но я попробую развернуть мысль. Я знаю, что многим нравится мрачная впечатывающая в стену атмосфера игр Р Михальски, так что без обид. Игра реально жесткая, шокирующая и точно останется в памяти. Это круто. Некруто количество мяса&amp;гнили&amp;личинок и прочей бутафории, которой в игре черезчур много. Мне кажется, есть намного более более элегантные способы испугать и шокировать игрока, дак игра ими и пользуется очень часто. Выходит месиво из психологически мощного хоррор стиля и техасской резни бензопилой. И, иногда некоторые моменты будто из другой игры. Они интересные и мощные, но автор будто не особо задумывался о том, как подвязать их вообще к основной истории. Мое личное мнение. - Графика. Если не знать, что это движок AGS, то можно не поверить. Художественные и режиссерские скиллы реально творят чудеса. Дубовая анимация даже подчеркивает общий стиль. И все же, игра не ЙОБА, бюджетность заметна, а анимации таки дубовые. Я бы был очень рад увидеть лучшее от Downfall и Among The Sleep в одной игре.  .... продолжение в комментах, а то слишком жирно для Стима вышло",1,0

35450,Rising Storm/Red Orchestra 2 Multiplayer,"My name is John Le'borsho, Im from Lake Charles, Louisiana. I was drafted, like my friends and brothers, into a war that had to be fought. I was 19....just had my birthday, when our ship got the news, we were headin to a island named Iwo Jima. Since me and my squad hadn't seen a fight, we waited to land on the second wave. They told us about this place, how they burned it to flat earth, yet the tojo still hid somehow, I aint gonna lie, I was scared. I sat there, ready to load into the landing craft, reading my Bible, when our Navy Corpsman, Justin Landry, walked up and tapped me on the helmet. 'Its time to go son.' he said quietly. Grabbing my Garand, I got ready to load up at our Captains command....I dont really remember the ride, it was quiet on the boat, the faint sound of gunshots started to grow however. Suddenly, the vessel shook violently, throwing me down. As I climbed to my feet, I looked to my right, to see a boy, Pvt.Rick Barson, slumped in the corner, blood pouring out his neck from shrapnel. 'Oh my God.' is all I could breath out, before the landing boat suddenly slammed to a stop, the gate falling open....but I just kept staring at the body. 'UNLESS YOU WANNA END UP LIKE HIM, GET YOUR ♥♥♥ MOVING!' The Corpsman yelled at me, throwing me off the boat and into the inch deep water washing the sand.   Quickly I grabbed my rifle and started running, bodies laid on the beach, craters filled the rocky sand, blood soaked the ground. I saw a squad of Marines on the top of the crest of the beach, handing out ammo and supplies. 'Whats the situation Corporal?' our 2ndLT yelled out. 'This is the 3rd ♥♥♥♥ing day sir, and the tojo are hanging on the that damn mountain with their lives. We are pushing, but not quickly. They keep trying to flank left from the mountain, we are barely keeping them back, with all spares moving up the mountain!' the Cpl shouted over planes, tanks and cannon fire. 'Then we are going to back up Sgt.Nickle's squad boys!' Our 2nd LT yelled to us, and we quickly nodded.  Running through the woods, we couldnt get past the smell of burning flesh, and flies everywhere, till we finally came to a small dip in the rocks, to see a half dead squad of Marines, fending off about 200 japanese imperial soldiers. 'Pvt.Daniel, Corporal.Youngblood, get up on that rock and set up the 30.cal Browning, Lance Corporal and PFC on me, PFC.John and Justin, go help those Marines on the right of those barricades, NOW GO!'   As I ran past whizzing bullets and dead bodies, I saw the Marines we were assisting. One was holding a patch on his side, blood oozing out as he fired from his side with his 45. , the other was young, but firing frantically with his Browning Auto Rifle, and the third, was carefully picking shots with a 30.caliber carbine. I then realized this was the Sargent, so I ran to his side and dropped down as Justin landed beside the wounded Marine. 'Sargent, are you ok!?' I asked. 'SHUT UP AND SHOOT!' was his response.   As I leaned up, a sudden blast of dirty hit me in the face and a round landed 5 inches from me, quickly making me drop back down. I regained my senses and gripped my 30-06 tightly, leaning back out to pick a target....but I couldn't, cause just as zebras confuse lions, there where to many to count, or focus on.....so I waited till one ran infront of my sights and......bang...miss. I was starled, I was an expert marksman, so I took another bead and....bang.. I watched the japanese soldier run a few more feet before stumbling, and suddenly slumping to the ground.....I had killed a man.I stared for a moment as the world stood still, only to come back and fire again, and again, and again and again till *Ping*. Looking down at my open chamber, I went to reach for another enbloc clip, when suddenly the BAR Marine yelled 'LOOK OUT, MOVE!'   I glanced up just in time to see a slow, light mortar land 7 feet from me. Then I just laid there....I had been thrown, I chunk of my leg was missing from the side, the wounded Marine had a shoulder and arm missing, the BAR Marine was laying on his back, firing until a round hit his heart, Justin was going hand to hand with a Tojo officer, the Sargent was trying to get his Colt out, and the Tojo had just brought friends. I saw the 2nd LT try to get to us, on for a hell of rounds hit the cover he was behind. So I just laid there, a load ring was all I could hear, my vision tunneling. I watched as Justin overpowered the officers, stealing his short sword and killing stabbing him with it, before drawning the officers nambo from his holster and firing at Japs heading to me. A wave of gun fire hit the officer, and Justin as they both fell over, and a Tojo ran up to me, sticking a bayonet to my chest.  As I tried to reach up and grab his arm, he laughed and pushed down. I groaned, and grabbed his arm, trying to push back and use my other hand to grab his grenade. However, suddenly a round smashed into his chest, throwing him off of me, and about 20 Marines ran out the trees, some shooting, others charging the Tojo. I watched as the officer's body somehow rolled off Justin, only to watch the Corpsman push off the dead body and get up, holding his side and firing a type 100. I looked up as another Corpsman lifted me up to a sitting position. I heard a young Marine yell out, 'LOOK, ON TOP OF THE HILL!' and I glanced to see what he was worked up about.  And among the hell and chaos, I saw a poll, with a small American flag on it, get slammed into the face of that mountian, claiming in for the U.S.A., I watched it wave in the wind as Justin and the 2nd LT ran over.....then I passed out.....and was calm",1,1
50300,Spec Ops: The Line,"After watching the trailer, I wasn't going to play Spec Ops: The Line - it looked like just another war-glorifying soldier hero game, Battlefield of Duty 26. Then I read some of the reviews, many of which rave about the game's plot exploring the horrors of armed conflict, etc. On the strength of the reviews, I decided to give it a try.  Having just finished the single-player campaign, I can't bring myself to go farther than a solid  meh . The plot, while slightly more involved than I had feared, was still fairly shallow. Additionally, it wasn't supported by the gameplay. For a game that tries so hard to make the player consider the ethics of his actions, it gives the player remarkably few choices, and the ones it does give only highlight the lack of the others.   For example, there are multiple occasions throughout the game where the player is unable to advance without committing a war crime, so it seems a bit petty in contrast that the biggest of maybe five actual choices given the player is whether to fail to rescue another soldier or whether to fail to rescue a group of captive civilians.    The gameplay is also fairly bland and repetitive. Most of the game is spent crouching behind sandbags and shooting dudes in the face. Advance to next area, find more sandbags, shoot more dudes in the face. There's very little opportunity to involve stealth, strategy, or anything but frontal assault. There are a couple of sequences where you get to do something different, like cover your squad's escape or act as a helicopter's gunner, but those are few and far between. The enemy forces are very monotone - the entirety of the game is populated with Basic Soldier™, who carries one of a handful of weapons, maybe a dozen Edged Weapon Experts, each of whom can inflict more damage with a single stab than Basic Soldier can with fifteen bullets to the face, and another dozen Heavy Troopers, who are to absorbing damage what Edged Weapon Experts are to dealing it.  I played through the game on Ubuntu 15.04 - it seems to be a solid port, although  holy loading hitches, Batman!  I took about 7 hours to finish the single-player campaign.  Overall, I have to say that, unless you  really  love shooting dudes in the face or have always wanted to see what it's like to blow up postapocalyptic Dubai   or rain down white phosphorus onto hundreds of helpless refugees  , it's probably best to pass on Spec Ops: The Line.",-1,1

233130,Shadow Warrior,"I'll just start this out by saying that Shadow Warrior is fun incarnate. I love this game. Let's start with some of the small things that it just does well.   The humor in SW is great, but obviously people have very selective humor. If you enjoyed Saints Row, Serious Sam, Borderlands, and Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, then you will enjoy the humor here. It can be very immature and juvenile, but it is done so in a smart-ish way. While the main weapon is a katana, I can equip The Penetrator (purple ♥♥♥♥♥ bat) from Saints Row. The fortune cookies are some things that I am always on the lookout for. They are hilarious and sometimes pretty insightful ('You don't need a parachute to skydive, you need a parachute to skydive twice'). The writing is great and you will love the references if you have been alive since the 80s.  The graphics in SW are stunning. From a technical level, it isn't anything that is too stunning, maybe in the top 5-10% of modern games. The art style and the aesthetics in SW are some of the best I have ever seen. If Trine were a first-person game and set in Japan, it would be SW. The colors used are perfect contrasts to the blood and gore that will be everywhere after each engagement. Speaking of the blood and gore, this game nails it. Body parts get diced up well, innards pour out onto the ground, and enemies react to their missing appendages realistically. Not a game for the queasy players. Physics and explosions look glories with all the particle effects. Looking for great desktop backgrounds? This game is a goldmine for that.  Gameplay... I'm just going to lump this into general satisfaction of the combat, both melee and gun-based, the enemies, and the abilities. This game is crazily satisfying to play. The melee is the best I have seen from a first-person game (beating out Zeno Clash, Elder Scrolls, Chivalry, and even Dark Messiah). Every strike just feels right and the intensity that is increased as the game progresses makes you feel like challenged all throughout the game. Triggering the abilities can be tricky and take some time to get a solid grasp of (double tapping W, A, S, and D then left/right clicking can be difficult while already moving around using W, A, S, and D) but after a couple hours will seem very natural.   Again, fun incarnate. Shadow Warrior is just pure fun. It takes the fun from classic shooters (fast paced, skill centric, finding secrets) and modernizes it in a great way.   5/5",1,0

266210,One Way Heroics,"In addition to the Steam version, I've also logged another 50 hours on One Way Heroics Plus. Even at full price, it's totally worth it, if you're even tangentially into procedurally generated roguelikes.  PROS: Three dollars at full price, and constantly going on sale. Several ways to beat the game. Nearly infinite replay value. OWH+ has already been released on playism, and adds even more depth to the game. Nobody is immune to anything. If it says it works, it will work. No more pesky 'Poison only works on player, but not bosses' nonsense.  CONS: dated graphics Weapons are hard to keep forever (Not that you need them, but you grow attached). Poor scaling for super long runs. There's no setting between 'You slaughter this guy' and 'You die in one hit'",1,0

255300,Journey of a Roach,"The Good    mostly creative puzzles that often require you think outside the box without drifting off too far into the illogical or incomprehensible   a refreshingly unusual and very well executed setting (a society of various vermin that has formed underground after the surface was destroyed in a nuclear apocalypse) with a nicely simple story   charming visuals   proper 'cockroach gameplay'; you can crawl on walls and on the ceiling, for example.     The Meh    The game uses direct controls (stick/d-pad or WASD keys) rather than point&amp;click for movement. This is perfectly fine for the most part and makes sense given the premise, but since you can't just click anywhere on the screen and wait for the pathfinding to do the rest, as you would in a point&amp;click, it's occasionally a bit tiresome and tricky to position your little cockroach just right where it needs to be.   It's not exactly an epic game as far as length is concerned. It took me a little over three hours to complete and that's including me being an idiot quite a few times.     The Ugly    No major issues found. I've played through the entire game without ever running into anything that would have ruined the fun.    Overall   **This summary contains minor puzzle spoilers** While the game wasn't quite what I expected, I ended up enjoying it a lot. I particularly liked the creative puzzle design, which requires you to be observant and really get into the logic of the game and its world. For example, you'll find yourself having to electrify yourself to use your own body as a battery, or dump radioactive waste on fish food to make a cute goldfish mutate into a giant monster that explodes out of its aquarium. It's all good, wacky adventure fun. I also liked the simplicity of the story and the complete absence of any dialogue in favor of speech and thought symbols, the latter feature (in combination with the fact that you're playing as a cockroach) actually reminded me a bit of the excellent Bad Mojo, which is always a good memory to invoke.   In summary, Journey of a Roach is a somewhat brief but thoroughly enjoyable and very charming adventure experience.",1,0

570,Dota 2,"Are you a masochist ? A misanthrop ? If so this is the game that combines the two things you love the most, agonizing yourself and hating others.  The game has complex mechanics that can take a while if not forever to master. Denying creeps, minimaxing builds to match your enemy's linupe, juking, creep blocking, pulling, camp stacking, smoke ganking, fog blitzing, and of course, outplaying another hero who has more farm with your wits. Bottom line, this ain't league of legends son, so if you haven't played this game for at least 6k hours, you'll likely receive the 'Hahah c y k a noob bljat, report' treatment every single match you play.   On one side of the spectrum, you can lead an easy going, stress free, and productive life. On the other side of the spectrum, you can choose to have no social life aside from 12 year old strangers that constantly engage you in flame wars, and no willingness to do anything aside from complaining about how unfair the ranked matchmaking system is. Usually it's an obvious choice, but the charm of DOTA forces you to go against what you know is right, siding with a guilty pleasure to your own detriment.  This game is also against racism and fundementalist nationalism, as no matter what server or language preference you set, there's always at least one Russian, one Mexican, and South East Asian player in the match. This game allows you to hate every human being equally and goes out of its way to remind you why you should actually hate them in case you've ever forgotten.  Most of the cast from DOTA 1 was implemented into this game, yet some of my favorites like Pit Lord and Arc Warden are yet to be transfered although it was promised ages ago. Instead we got some nice new items and more false promises. Its seems Gaben uses the compendium money to design even more compendiums and get even more compendium money, instead of greenlighting the release of these final two heroes. (or Half life 3)  To keep it brief, if you ever wanted to try something so horrible that it eventually grows to be amazing in your eyes, this is it.  Would get shadow blade on Silencer and get 100 Intelligence steal, hex then orchid, one shotting everything with glaives again/10. #Slahsersway",1,0

Never actually gave any game of the clicker type a try. Starting to think my judgement was way off.  This game is a extremely fun casual game. I don't need twitch reflexes, or pro twinking knowledge at building characters. None of that stuff. Just watch the game go buy and make slight adjustments here or there depending on what is currently going on. It seems to run in some fashion even when it shut down on my computer. I haven't looked to see how. I think it might be a online server that calculates there stats virtually. It could also just be it calculating your current average gold per minute and adding that times the amount of down time it had next time you start it up.  Recomend for anyone and everyone. At its current price I seriously doubt you won't get your moneys worth. Even if you are someone like Bill Gates. Whos time is worth a serious amount of money. This game is still worth the cost.",1,0

I really, really hate that they just didnt give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about the pc ports and gave alot of time to the consoles. I hope warner bros. has finally learned their lesson about pc games and will try their hardest not to do this again. Now that I have addressed the obvious, time for the actual review. I was very pleased with the storyline. It was like there was multiple big storylines all in one. How scarecrow terrorized the city and screwed with batmans head, how the joker played a huge part of the story and was still dead, and the history of the arkham knight (Jason Todd) and batman played. The batmobile was getting very repetitive and boring in some parts. Some people didnt like that the arkham knight was the redhood and wanted someone different. I like how the took a different take with Jason. It gave it a little suspense and still gave us a character we know and love but with a new background. Without the poorly made ports i give Arkham Knight a solid 8/10.",1,0

You can kill a lot of zombies, just like other zombie games, but you should always be careful as resources are limited, your melee weapon breaks, and you can die permanently. Clashing head to head with zombies is not always the best option. Sometimes you have to sneak.  You ensure that your home base has enough food, medicine, materials, and ammo. You can also find new survivors around but always think that they will be additional load for our limited resources.  The game 'runs' even when you turn off the game.  My only downside here are the bugs and ultra graphics does not look so good.",1,0

I have seen people power level up in a matter of days and while that is rather fast, there are plenty of things to do that increase game play other than grinding, and I really do not see a grind to this game.  What I like the most is the side missions, the echos, the cellphones. All of the little details that are in this game that piece together a larger story line and tell it as you find it. That is where I think this game has done a good job.  The Graphics on this are really good. Very clean and clear and enchances the environment of the game itself.  I do like the aspect of the DarkZone. It puts another level onto this game with the PVP and teamplay aspect. It always helps to have a good group of people to play with also.",1,0

If you enjoyed SimCity2000 / 4 and were disappointed by the latest version, this game is just the fix you have been looking for and at a great price.

42160,War of the Roses,Do Not Play This Game!!!! Unless you enjoy being team killed and boosted.

When i was able to move and hit the enemy players i only did 1-3 damage even with a fully charged hit but everytime i was hit i was instantly knocked down.. This game isnt worth even downloading it was broken on release and is still broken now but worse because of the team killers and spawn kill boosters.. This game needs some serious fixing and spawn issues to address before anyone should even consider downloading it.. My rating for this would be 2/10 the only reason im giving it that high a rating is because i could Alt-F4 to close it.. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!,-1,0

FireFall is an addictive MMOFPS with a mixure of elements from Borderlands, Sanctum 2, an a little bit of Section 8, and while it doesn't deliver on the best aspect of each one, the way it meshes together is really great, and adds for a fun experience. The way people get together whenever a mission pops up, while not original (I heard Guild Wars 2 has a similar mechanic), is a blast, which raises it above other F2P MMOs, and the gun combat is engaging and satisfying. Progression feels genuine, and more often than not, FireFall does NOT feel like a free to play game, though there are times when it does lose that illusion, such as a store window popping up for 'red beans' and cosmetic items.",1,0

108710,Alan Wake,"I bought this game on the winter sale for dirt cheap ($2.50). I didn't play it for a month, it was hard to get 'in to' it. But a friend pressured me to give it a try so I did and I can hinestly say that it was one of if not THE best adventure games I've ever played (up there with hl2 andTWD)   The graphics were amazing, but some of the gameplay seemed redundant, but it was still fun. You learned to conserve your ammo and move quickly.  Yes, this is a scary game, my friend and I joked that I 'noped' through a lot of it instead of facing the enemies (sometimes this didn't benifit me because I would get lost).  There aren't really very many 'jumpscares' but the game does mess with your head a little bit.  The controls were a tad weird at first, considering this game is meant to originally be played on peasantbox360, but I solved that problem by turning the sensitivity WAY down.  The current price of 30 USD is well worth to those who are looking for some 'cheap entertainment' *icarly reference* And I would pay for it hadn't I bought it on the winter sale.  Overall the game was amazing, but for some reason the sound didn't work all the time (may be due to my multiple monitor display) but I couldn't find anyone else who ever had the same issue as me so I guess it was a personal problem.  The gameplay took me 15 hours, and included some very challenging puzzles reminiscent to Half-Life2 and may take 20 hours for someone who wants to stop and not 'NOPE' through it like I did  Amazing graphics quality and storyline   9.5/10",1,0

Plus it has HATS!! Which all Steam users can appreciate. This game is like you took BoI and Diablo3 and put them in a blender. I like this game a lot so far and i'm only level 30 with the Archer character (but i have played all the classes and they are all good in their own way). Rogue-Like Twin-Stick RPG is the best way i can describe this game. Definitely worth the price, no question.",1,0

432150,NA,Looked at the reviews and thought 'Hey this game can not be that bad.' I was surprised how right many of the reviews were. The premise is a dumbed down Lemmings. The problem is that they took out some nice thi9ngs from that game. It feels like they just dumped this as fast as they could onto the market to get some money.  Pros: All achievements can be done in 2 hours (because all are time based and have nothing to do to gain achievements) Steam Cards (and at the moment the cards are extremely cheap)  Cons: Bad controls since I could find no keys on my keyboard that did anything (would have helped if the 1-0 on the keyboard selected certain blocks instead of always having to go down and select the specific block) Icons were confusing (beginning level there are all the blocks shown in the lower left corner but all but one have a square underneath them) Only way to restart is to kill the Batarians (or whatever they are called) instead of having like R make the level restart. No Tutorial (they just drop you in the game) No Pause (have to play really fast because if you dont you lose your chance of actually beating the level) No Story (Dont think there is a story because played for awhile and beat many levels but never saw anything about a story)  Overall I would give it a 2/10 and I am being generous. I would not recommend unless you want the cards and the easy achievements.,-1,0

It's fun making new characters of different classes and learning new builds, trying out different approaches to maps..there's always something fun you can be doing. Definitely worth the money for all the DLC as well. While not 100% essential, the extra character classes are very handy.",1,0
38450,MDK,Took me forever to get around to playin this game but I was pleasantly surprised by how fun and insane it was. The plot is nonexistant you just know there's aliens and you gotta shoot em in the face with your incredible and sick sniping skills. The game has you constantly switching between a machine gun arm and a sniper weapon both are fun to use and while the multi screen sniper cams aren't really that useful but they're fun to watch. The graphics are very dated but i enjoy the style. They're very dark in desgin and lighting. If i do have a few compliants though is that being a nearly 17 year old game it has some issues running on current pcs. Also missing its instructional manual there are some features I was unaware of that got me stuck in some areas. But that aside I recommend this. Its a fun off the wall shooter.,1,0
319510,Five Nights at Freddy's,"LASTING IMPRESSIONS Five Nights at Freddy's  GENRE Horror/Point-And-Click  STORY Five Nights at Freddy's follows the story of Mike Schmidt, the new night guard for the vintage pizzeria starring the animatronic characters Freddy Fazbear, Chica the Chicken, Bonnie the Bunny, and Foxy the Pirate Fox. Upon starting his first night, Mike is informed by the previous night guard of his duties; check the cameras, make sure everything stays in place, and don't get murdered by the animatronics. You know, the usual. Mike must now survive five(seven) nights in the building making sure to not run out of power, not get murdered by haunted robots, and get his paycheck.  GAMEPLAY The gameplay is fairly basic; easy to learn, hard to master. As your job is to guard the building, you must constantly check the cameras. This will allow you to know where the animatronics are, and keep some of them in place. Along with the camera you have the doors and the lights. The doors are used to keep any and all animatronics at bay should they decide your office would be a nice place to sneak into. The lights will let you know if Bonnie or Chica are outside of their respective doors, so that you may promptly close it right in their faces. Be careful not to forget that this pizzeria has fallen on hard times, and is running on a battery of sorts. All appliances run on this battery, and if you run out of power; it's over.  FINAL THOUGHTS Five Nights at Freddy's is the first horror game I've ever played. In my first couple play sessions I was spooked solid. The game left me on edge, paranoid, and gave me a cold feeling inside. Sadly, the feeling didn't last. After a couple more play sessions it wasn't scary, it was frustrating. It had devolved from a horrific version of Night Trap to Night Guard Simulator 2014. I could only get enjoyment out of it by playing it with friends in a skype call. While I still enjoyed the whole look of the game and got quite engrossed the lore behind it all, I couldn't slog my way through all the nights. Five Nights at Freddy's did not leave a lasting impression, but I'll give it props for trying.  Also, minimum wage for that? Bull. ♥♥♥♥.",-1,1

8400,Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved,"A really great 'old school' arcade shooter with some extra visual pizazz and razzle-dazzle thrown in. Very much a throwback to the visual design of Tempest and the gameplay of Robotron 2084. It's hard to play the game for more than 15 minutes at a time because of the repetitive nature, but that also makes it the perfect game to pick up and mess with when you're waiting around for other things.   There's a sequel out for the Xbox360 arcade which I dearly hope to see on Steam someday along with a pseudo-sequel called Geometry Wars Galaxies for the Nintendo DS and Wii. The DS game is AWESOME and totally worth playing if you can get it.  One thing to remember, -this game can be played with a mouse and keyboard, but you WILL WANT a dual-stick gamepad to enjoy it properly.",1,0

384190,ABZÛ,"in the first 30 minutes of gameplay i was flashed by a white light enough times to suffer an epileptic seizure (if i could suffer one).

I'm sure this is a beautiful game with stunning fish and beautiful scenery, but I couldn't see any of it because of this crappy little robot swimming with me. Either get rid of the robot or remove it's little light trail because this game sucks balls, if i can't see anything i don't want to play it.

The music, the atmosphere, the gameplay, everything is great, the difficulty is pretty easy even at the highest difficulty but it's all right, I've seen worse. It's not a strategy game at the same time so let's be fair. I really love this game, both F.E.A.R. and F.E.A.R. 2 are great games. Unvaluable gems In my opinion, of course, unlike the third one which is a fine game but not so great considering it is a F.E.A.R. game.  You should absolutely get this game if you don't already have it, fan of FPS? Horror? Great music? Great atmosphere? You'll love it.   This game deserves 9/10 In my opinion.

47780,Dead Space 2,"A really good, immersive and atmospheric sequel to a scifi/horror action game, with a barebone story, that no gamer (or a scifi movie buff) should miss out on. Unless the said gamer is skittish about the amount of gore this game has. Like on the previous one, the scary/horror part is a lot of jumpscares, but the game is building tension in many places too. The story goes full ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on this one, but the atmosphere makes up for it.  But BEWARE of the bad PC port that is hard to control properly without a controller and has forced console DLCs embedded into the main game. The controls are better than in DS1, but still not good. Mouse input is filtered and 'rubberbandy'. And the DLCs add late game/replay items that are usable at the START of the game, which f's up the normal game item progression. The DLC problem is fixable with unofficial downloadable files.",1,0

321950,Yury,"Very neat pixel retro graphics platformer with high difficulty. Sadly it has a lot of flaws. Firsty the controls are not crisp enough for an unforgiving trial and error platformer, you feel somewhat floaty. Then there seems to be a problem with the engine, because the game gets slower every time you restart or kill an enemy. In the end it slows down so much, that it will begin to stutter for a few frames every second. Last but not least this games suffers of very bad level design, it starts of pretty good and chellenging but the farer you get, the more tedious and boring it gets. In the end you jump over 200 floating platforms with no background or design whatsoever, just to hit a trap hidden behind scenery or placed stupidly hard, just so you have to jump over 200 boring platforms for 5 minutes again to reach that spot. This game needs a lot of work but could turn still out fun to play for retro platform fans.",1,1

205100,Dishonored,"A great first-person stealth game in its own right. Combat is one of the best I've ever played. Atmosphere is eerily dystopian, story is dynamic and can differ from playthrough to playthrough, and soundtrack is quite appropriate if not excellent. The game mixes different unusual gadgets/weapons as well as mechanics (e.g. teleporting/blink) to create an experience unique from your average fps.  However, in a way, Dishonored discourages the use of violence to achieve goals (killing lots of people results in higher chaos, more enemies, and a negative ending). Unless you don't mind all that and you're into murdering everything you see. Which is actually really fun, considering that there are just about a hundred ways that you can perform assassinations. The moral binary does get annoying, though.",1,0
322500,SUPERHOT,"Just so many poor design choices. The concept is great and at times it plays fantastic but it has so many annoyances built in with it that I can't recomend it.  The audio design is just plain bad; I see it's trying to bring in a minimalist tech vibe but it is often just annoying and rarely can you determine where you are being fired upon through sound, on harder levels the horrible buzz it plays when respawning gets migrane inducing. I found a good relief for this by playing Ave Maria over the audio and basking in the blisful slow motion with memories of Hitman.  The story is the blandest attempt at meta-narratives I have ever seen; this would be okay if the game played that with tounge in cheek but it feels like its constantly trying really hard and failing every step of the way. One moment tries to pull the 'oh no you can't turn off the game!' move to which I laughed and killed it through task manager; I would have felt that was just a silly chuckle worthy moment if I didn't then have to wait through the entire self-agrandising moment again upon loading.  All in all it's basically Hotline Miami without the smart desgin and usually not as fun.",-1,0

325610,Total War: ATTILA,"A completly different TW game.   This game is totally revamped. Finding a nice middle spot between Rome 2 and more formation style Napoleon, Attila hits the player with impressive graphics. Faction politics feel like they matter more in this game. The sanitation feature brings an interesting aspect to the public order function, but don't fret too much about internal rebellions. As long as your provinces have solid garrisons and/or 10+ unit armies in the immediate area, rebellions are easily overlooked.The entire public order system, however, is much more sensitive.   Research, while neccessary, does not limit civ growth too much. The obvious attraction in this game is to go for the big factions (Roman, Sassanid, Huns, etc.), but the real fun is as the smaller nations, IMHO.   On the DLC, I have only done Age of Charlemagne. It plays as a good DLC should, in that in introduces a small 'sub-game' off the base game, with unique factions and a harder level of play. The other DLCs are only worth if one is absolutly dying to play as a certain faction.   Great game. While new players will enjoy it, those who have played other games in the TW series will get the most enjoyment out of it.",1,0

422900,Particle Fleet: Emergence,"So why the positive you ask? What is so special about a simple game about some space ooze? It is more than that. This is the 4th installment of a series of games, each better than the last. One person putting out a game and not ignoring it after it's release. One guy refusing to take my money before it is in stores. No early access, no pay before you see what your getting. What back up, paying for a game usually means you pay, then play right? WRONG! Can we say free demo? That's right, a demo in 2016. You would think it was 1996 the way this guy operates. Maybe more gaming companies should take notice.  So here are the pros and cons....  Pros- - A full story line that builds off of the 3 previous games. You should buy those as well, but not needed to enjoy the game.  - A fully working random map generator with user options enhancing the replay value indefinitely.  - A ship editor, you can make a ship from scratch, or many and even share them within the game.  - A map editor, also allowing you to share with others.  - Did I mention a devoper that isn't just grabbing your money and leaving for Timbuktu?    So here are the cons-  - The ship editor in general is pro, but also a con. It is clumbsy, it has no tool tips (what the heck does a port do vs a laser?) The deveoper has stated he plans to add that in a post release patch. Experimentaion will answer many of those questions. You can copy and paste from an old ship, but I still haven't figured out how to do that. I would say a complete rework of the ship editor is in order, but needless to say, it is adaquet for the game.  -Although some have pointed out some bugs, I have yet to run into any that are game breaking. While I put that under the cons, it is really a pro.    In all fairness, this game is worth the full price, it is simple to learn, but difficult to master. This is much like the three other creeper world titles. This one gets my full support and should be in everyone's library.",1,1

However, it is hard for modern gamers to get into. Graphics I can handle, I play Doom after all. But the combat is the weakest point. It is classic Bethesda style FPD&amp;D dice rolling combat. On top of that, it starts out as near impossibly hard, then breaks apart, and if you know what to exploit, you can break the game within first hour of gameplay.  Still, get this game simply because Skywind will require it.",1,0

270880,American Truck Simulator,"It's basically ETS 2 but with added features. But it's still a good game. Positives (New things/nicely done things) + Train yards + Trains look nice + AI cars are nice + Trucks are of course nice! + Map is lovely + Trailers look nice + Large modding community + ATSMP is coming soon + Difficulty improved + Fines are more realistic, though people think they suck, which they don't and there's probably much more  Cons - Small map at the time, people are scared of expensive microtransactions, but they promised us Arizona for free - Horns sound weird - Customization is too limited on the new trucks - Not too many trucks in game yet - Like in ETS 2, the cities seem too small - The railroad crossing sucks, the quad gates are kind of weird, there is no bell sound, and it's only a single power move! - I'm not sure if they're going to go all the way to the east coast and some more  Note: I am pretty sure they would not add Mexico or Canada being this game is more focused on the US.

251990,Long Live The Queen,"This game has the best frustration-balance I ever encountered in a game.   Build up to counter the death you just experienced, just to die even earlier this time because you did not train something you did on last try. It's possible to beat it without a guide, but you need either an extreme amount of luck, or very many playthroughs to get it right, and as someone who build myself up through a high number of playthroughs, I don't think I've ever been so satisfied with beating a game before. And by beating I mean not dying.   You play princess Elodie on her last weeks before being crowned a queen after the tragic death of her mother. Your goal is to survive until then. Apparently you're safe forever if you're a queen, even though you can die from absolutely anything before then.   You build up her day by taking her to lessons. You earn outfits that give bonuses to some stats. Your mood gives bonuses and disadvantages for learning certain lessons and doing a sparetime activity in the castle changes Elodie's mood. You can be a master tactician of every type or war and then die from poisoned chocolate. Having 0 knowledge actually mean 0 knowledge for Elodie and she does the dumbest things if she gets in a situation she knows nothing about. Creates a lot of humour in the game.  If you want every achievement you absolutely must use a guide to get the right skills at the right times, through many playthroughs. The game is more enjoyable if you play it to be crowned through knowledge you earn through many tries.  The game seems complicated at first try, but you easily get into it and learn to juggle skills, moods, classes, and, of course, dresses.   I recommend it, but be prepared for frustration, though you'll pull through because of the humour of the absurd deaths and the cutesyness of the game and music.",1,0

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"The game's great. A larger-scale Arkham City, albeit the only real new gameplay elements being the Batmobile. But this element is very well done. The Batmobile looks glorious, handles brilliantly and manages to be enough of a challenge to play with while still being fun even in the later stages.   There are a variety of diverse side cases/quests Batman can devote his time to in the wide open world of Gotham City. Riddler's challenges are as ubiquitous and taunting as ever, but now there are some other rogues angling to get Bats attention. The story is well written and engaging, no spectacular twists or hooks, but very thorough. The game runs beautifully on a 980 @ 1440p, usually 60-70 fps. Great to see an immediate response from WB, instead of just abject indifference. Not used to such drastic measures being taken by companies in response to criticism, although the criticism was one of the most massive in recent times. While this game doesn't completely reinvent the Arkham series the way City did, I can appreciate it's much harder to do that three games down the line. The game is a complete next-gen AAA title in every aspect and is pretty damn fun.",1,0

287290,Resident Evil Revelations 2,"I didn't expect much from this one, and yet I got much more out of it than from lots of other, far better reviewed games of recent memory.  First of all, the (first episode) of the story campaign is a well done mix of the old and new Resident Evil styles with room for bizarre body horror mutants and slow walking zombies as well. The pacing is really good and fun, violent action as well as slower moments of exploring the creepy hallways both coexist. The game is often surprisingly scary, especially in the second act where you control Barry.  And that's just the first two hours of the game: After that, there's the Raid Mode which turns out to be a completely different game in and of itself. It contains of a bunch of unique levels (not just recycled ones from the single player campaign). You have to shoot your way through them, earn points, purchase new skills and weapons, earn trophies, unlock new levels and then do it all again with another character. It unfolds an incredibly depths and enables a variety of completely different play styles and I'll probably sink many hours into it.  That's what I got for just 6€. It's an incredibly good value for a well produced and polished game (especially the game play). After all the discussions of The Order: 1886 I hope this game might serve as an example of how smaller AAA games can succeed with a more humble pricing and a high focus on gameplay. Resident Evil Revelations 2 has one priority: offering an enjoyable and fun time.",1,0

367580,Hook,"Hook takes a simple puzzle idea and does it very well, it has you playing around with increasingly more complex circuits that control hooks and rods which must be removed in the correct order to remove every last hook in the level; a bit like pick-up sticks, just virtual, 2D, and with some actual thought, not just throwing stuff on the ground. Unlike pick-up sticks, this game is actually quite good.  The visuals and music are minimalist, but are not boring; in a way, they make it easier to concentrate on the game; the gameplay is interesting enough that interesting music and flashy visuals really just aren't needed.  Although the gameplay is quite simple, the puzzles are built in very interesting and challenging ways, especially towards the end.  Hook most definitely has an exponential learning curve, but this is core to making the game a challenging and fun experience; however, this means that for most of the first half-hour you will be solving very easy and obvious puzzles while new features are being slowly introduced. Towards the end you get very complex levels with tangles of lines that you have to think about a bit to be able to solve, these levels are the most fun IMO, and when it ended I just wanted infinitely more levels that I could play for ever and ever.  The small amount[of levels[50] is my only qualm with this game, however for the price this is quite reasonable. I do think that a level designer and community levels are much needed additions however.  I would recommend this game, because the concept and the levels are extremely fun and rewarding to play through. For 79p this is absolutely worth picking up. However if puzzle games aren't your thing, you probably wouldn't enjoy it it.",1,0
248820,Risk of Rain,"When you first start playing RoR it feels like an empty, badly balanced shooter/platformer but stay alive long enough to level up to say 4 to 6,and your bullets start doing more damage and it actually becomes much more enjoyable. Initally it's seems a really tough game but then you learn to approach the enemies with different attack combinations of weapons which, when fired in the right order, foes that seemed to take ages to die begin to take seconds (well some of them do!)  Once this realisation of the game's true depth kicks in it becomes very addictive. I think before you activate a teleport you should probably try to get your character to level 10-15 as the bosses sequences are rock hard and I haven't actually managed to finish level 1 yet! But I'm not massively bothered, it's fun just to run around shooting enemies and staying alive longer than last time.  PS: I got this game for 66% discount.",1,0

The game starts out easy but quickly ramps up to absolutely challenging enemies (who use cheap tactics familiar to 'old school' gamers, such as instant-death attacks). The game started out with its drawbacks and bugs, but it is being patched daily and already the experience has vastly improved. If you want a challenging experience for you and your friends, then pick up Magicka today. I'll gladly join you in-game.",1,0

214590,Fairy Bloom Freesia,"Freesia is a fairy, and her job is protecting Lita Forest. How does she do so, you ask? Why, by beating the everlasting crap out of everything that threatens it, of course!  It's an arena beat-em-up, basically. Between levels you get to the store and purchase skills, level them up, customize your skill set, and more. The end result being that you can have Freesia beat the everlasting crap out of everything that threatens Lita Forest exactly how you want her to.  The game's graphics are simple, colorful, and effective. The music compliments the game well. The controls (at least, the gamepad controls) are fully customizable. There's also humor to be had, both in the game and its achievement list.  Story Mode itself is fairly short, but you unlock Guardian Mode after beating it the first time, which plays similarly to the Survival Mode present in many fighting games.  The only glaring issue is the difficulty spike better known as the third boss, Shynie. This is generally when you discover how abusable the invulnerability frames on the backdash are. You'll eventually get into the rhythm of backdashing through her attacks, getting off a short combo, closing the distance, and repeating the process.  Overall, it's a fun way to spend some time, and definitely worth picking up. If in doubt, well, there's a demo you can try. It gives you the first five 'days', which encompasses the tutorial and the first boss. It doesn't sound like much, but it's enough to know whether or not you'll like it.",1,0

275850,No Man's Sky,"At the time of writing this review, I've played the game for 7 hours and I plan to play a lot more.  I love the exploration and survival aspects. Every game has some form of repetativeness to it, at least No Man's Sky gives you a change of scenery. Start on a barren ocean planet, move to a vastly colourful and vibrant planet.  I've not had to 'hack' my settings to get better performance, I was getting a solid 40-60 fps, after attemping one or two performance 'hacks' I get up to 85fps, which isn't much of an improvement overall as I'm still enjoying the game just as much.  Gameplay has it's challenges, and I don't mean understanding how to do things. An upgrade needs a resource? Go find it, You're getting attacked by space pirates, bloody well shoot them down.  No game is without faults, I've had a far worse experience in more mainstream AAA titles.",1,0

The bumbling stupidity of these troops to execute orders without tripping over one another, or obstructing one another is stupifying. It's like trying to run a painting company with the three stooges, except it's an entire army of stooges in a restricted locational overview. Add to the sheer stupidity of these guys the macros, keybinds, tactics incongruity, and building area restrictions, and you have another frustrating exercise trying to coordinate strategies with illogical menu interfaces. More and more, I see developers who can't place menus in smart locations away from the center, out of the way, without obstructing MY view. It is funny how the robot invaders range, and field of view advantages exceed my own, and they trap my stupid army in an ambush while they move intelligently and easily to surround us.  I save a lot of money on games now, but can't get refunds for glitchy, clumsy interfaces, and unfair 'stupid logic' as the only thing I have to command.",-1,1

The acting completely silly in some cases, and scene chewing in many others, and laugh out loud ridiculous? Yup..  Yet this game is exactly what it preports itself to be. A FMV game about spotting contridictions, to get further and further into a mystery. The puzzles as they are are genuinely 'aha, I got it!' inspiring, and the game has a generous hint and help system so your never in true fear of being stuck.   Perhaps had this been a full budget 60$ game the bad points, the coding and such would be an issue but for what they charge for the game? Its absolutely not a deal breaker. The good, fun, engaging and down right fantastic points of the game are absolutely worth the asking price.  A real big positive thumbs up from me. I hope to see them make a sequal, and at the low asking price this absoltuely passes the 'Did I get my moneys worth? Test. 5 hours for 10$? Seems overly generous for a game like this actually.

311690,Enter the Gungeon,"After playing this game extensively, I cannot reccomend Enter the Gungeon to most players. I see what the developers had hoped to make and while their influences are obvious (Binding of Isaac and Nuclear Throne are the most obvious), they failed to understand some of the mechanics of those games.  Basic enemies, the same enemies that you see in the first level, will appear in later ones with increased health. This hampers the feel of progress and also makes guns lose their effectiveness as the game goes on. Why not just have more low-level enemies but increase the number of them in each encounter as you progress?   I know these games can get real crappy if your RNG isn't right, but in Gungeon it's worse since each floor takes some time to complete. There are a massive amount of upgrades in this game - guns, stat increases, extra HP, items that enhance your Blanks (instead of bombs, blanks are pick-ups that open hidden walls AND destroy enemy bullets), even items that add an effect to flipping tables for cover. Yet due to all this variation you can wind up with a very weak start by getting a slew of joke/gimmicky guns, receiving niche upgrades such as table-flipping ones, or just not getting enough keys to open chests while the Shop has 4 pairs of hearts and a joke gun for sale.   I understand that this game's focus is on it's large collection of guns and yet I find myself hoping for a basic no-frills AK-47 or shotgun instead of something wacky that does low damage just because of how much HP-scaling enemies and bosses hamper this game. Ammo can be an issue as it's not guarenteed to drop at all and MIGHT be sold in the shop. I found myself carrying 3 empty guns by level 4 when I first got there; I had 4 by the time I reached level 5.  There are some nice quality-of-life improvements over it's contemporaries, but as a whole Enter the Gungeon left me feeling dissapointed after each run regardless of how well I did just because of how poorly equipped my loadout was - something that prior 'rogue-lite' games did not do.",-1,1

220240,Far Cry® 3,"Far Cry 3 is a sum of many ubisoft games, they have taken many features from their other IPs and successfully combined it with the tropical setting of far cry 1 the end result is a brilliant open world fps that is exciting to play till the end.  There is coop and competetive multiplayer in FC3, the PvP is decent fun you level up fairly quickly and have battle cries and can customize a lot, you can spend a decent amount of hours in it before getting bored, the PvE is really fleshed out and the characters are well written and is objective based you will have better luck finding a game in the competitive mp rather than the coop mp.  The single player is a very diverse,really fleshed out levels and thoroughly exciting until the end. The best part i loved about FC3 was that it rewarded stealth play example if you take out an outpost you get 500 xp take out the outpost but without triggering the alarm and you get 550 xp and if you take out the outpost without being detected you get 1500 xp. This is the reason why i almost always used stealth to take out outposts and you can do the same in most of the missions. The wildlife makes it feel like a real world where you can skin animals and sell it for cash or use for crafting, the herbivores will run away scared of you the carnivores will actively attack you and try to kill you, you can also set animals like bears,tigers and lions on the enemies by luring the animal to them or by shooting the caged animals which is a lot of fun.  Traversing through FC3 is a blast you can use the outposts you captured as fast travel, the cars are decent to use the water vehicles are very fun to use espically the jetski, the most fun you can have traveling is when you ziplines and the glider, later during the late game you will have access to wingsuit and paracute which makes traveling from one point to the other even more exhillariting and fun to do. FC3 is a looker it looks really good and the vistas change from region to region some of the segments are breathtaking, the level of detail if you can run it on very high/ultra is mindblowing, the lighting the shadows and the particle effects are really well done, the facial animation doesnt look that well but it is a 4 year old game now so cant complain too much. The jungle truly comes alive as the meshes of the trees grass and plants make it feel really life-like.  I feel FC3's villian characters are really interesting with backstories and are well developed especially Vaas whose voice actor really brings the character to life but the hero characters espcially the main hero J.Brody is not intersting nor convincing the character will blurt out stupid puns and make fun or everything and sometimes acts all serious making him feel like a man-child. The story is simple and the game has two endings, i only wish they made the 'bad' ending somewhat better but i guess then it wouldnt be the bad ending but overall the story is servicable and the characters for the most part are good.  There is a lot to do in FC3 from unlocking towers to view segments of the maps, free outposts to fast travel and access new items, complete side quests in which you are required to eliminate enmies or animals using speific wepons, looting is very fun and the game actively encourages you to do so the chalice ones are hard to do and fun since it makes you explore, apart from these you have races,gambling,knives throws, etc, so yeah a lot to do. FC3 tropical setting really helps the mood of the game and the nigh and day cycle really bring out the jungle vibe. The game doesnt have too many bugs or glitches, i did run into a few popups and stutters but mostly its looks good and runs well. The problem sometimes occues in mp when uplay decided to disconnect you automatically during game and its quite annoying but thanfully thats just on the mp side of the things.   You can crafy syringes to enhance your abilites and skin animals to upgrade carrrying ammo, extra guns and special bows.There are also some dlc missions which are quite good if you have them, blowing stuff up feels really rewarding and the enemy AI is really nice, they will try to flank you into the open they actively use grandes to make you go into open areas to kill you easily.The tagging system in FC3 really makes the stealth aspect very intriguing as you can tag the enemies observe their pattern to quitely assassinate them or set animals on them. The takedown feature is probably the best feature ive seen in video games reason being the variety of takedown you can perform, from the simplet takedown to chain,gunslinger,death from above/below, heavy and grande, each does something differnet and feels really satisfying.  Lastly the audio is really crispy and on point, some of the soundtracks are spot on the one instance where you light a weed farm on fire with flamethrower has skillrex's ft. damien marely make it bun dem is brilliant and become my faveourite track, you can hear the hissle of snakes and the roars of the tigers from a distance giving you audio feedback as how to approach your immediate surronding.  Overall an excellent open world game by ubisoft and truly back to the Far Cry roots and a step in the right direction since i considered FC2 a failure, FC3 is a game anyone can easily love and sink hours into you can spend anywhere between 20-40 hours doing all kinds of things, I completed all outposts and towers and many of the missions and still wanted to play for an hour or so coz travelling with the wingsuit was so darn fun.Easily recommeded to anyone at any price point.",1,1

However, the game did offer some interesting gameplay mechanics, its crude humor did get a chuckle or two out of me, and it did (for me) feel like a Postal game. In the end, its definitely not as great as Postal II, but still a decent game that I would play again. Too bad we'll (probably) never see any Mac/Linux ports...",1,1

280520,Crea,"Crea is an extremely enjoyable sandbox game, the engine is vibrant and the game play is solid and enjoyable. The game offers an immense amount of content as is expected of the genre, yet stands out in the deliverance of it. Everything is well organized and simplified in a friendly UI, so unlike some other games the players are not overwhelmed or lost in endless lists of craftables and items.    First off, I will need to point out the obvious, Crea is extremely similar to Terraria which is a well beloved and commercially successful game, so it's hard to do the same things Terraria does and do them well. Fortunately, Crea does not disappoint. The environment in Crea is lush, varied, and suitably deadly. There are mounds of things to collect and make, loads of enemies to face and challenging bosses to tackle. The controls in the game are responsive and have not yet caused my demise by being obtuse. The controls are fully map-able, and allow for both kb+mouse and controllers for those who feel they need them.  Crea has been stable since launch, both for single and multiplayer modes, and has kept me entertained by the many adorable and very-dead-because-I-need-mats critters it has thrown at me. The developers patched and ironed out most of the reported issues soon after the game's release, as well as continue to make weekly tweaks and fixes in the game. Showing how closely they monitor feedback from users, always nice to know that the products we use will be well maintained.  The game itself is simple enough to understand and get into; Most things in the environment can be gathers and used as materials for crafting weapons, clothing, structures etc. There is a level system which governs what items are available for crafting, as well as a skill system which uses accumulated points to unlock perks, passives and improvements to existing mechanics such as movement, gathering speed, combat prowess and so on. As a general rule sandbox games do not have a final goal or destination, but I suppose getting the bosses could be something close to that. Sadly, despite the tutorial, people who have never played a game in this genre might take a little while to get up to speed in Crea.   Pros:",1,0

The game overall though is fantastic. The world is brilliantly immersive, storyline was great, characters and voiceovers were brilliant as per the first and there is so much attention to detail.   If I was going to nitpick, I would say the stealth was sometimes inconsistent...and probably a little too easy. I literally stood at the feet of a guard and he didn't see me...till I knifed him of course.   Couldn't recommend it any higher.

450120,Capitalism Plus,"I played a ton of this 20 years ago. This was the proper conglomerate simulator - you start off with a pile of cash and start setting up firms. You could choose to simply be an import shop that sold port goods to local cities, you could start vertically integrating up the manufacturing chain to source raw materials and build factories to get your product to market, you could start horizontally integrating to buy out your opponents and achieve 100% market share in various goods. If you don't know much about business this is a solid game for you - I believe some of the marketing spiel for this game talked about how it was used at Harvard Business to illustrate basic business concepts. At its time it was one of the most complex and enjoyable simulators on the market  There are lots of silly little simplifications for the model - all labor is paid the same whether or not they're cashiers at the department store or researchers in a R&amp;D lab, for example. Your 'department stores' can only sell 4 things maximum. But hey, 20 year old DOS game.  Here's hoping CapII makes it onto steam (much better UI), or better yet the guy who made the games makes a CapIII.  EDIT: One sad thing about this game being on Steam and not on a box on a shelf is that the boxed shelf version came with a gigantic manual hundreds of pages long explaining how the business model in the game worked and how each firm and logical block in each firm interacted, as well as an enormous index of every product in the game and its supply chain and logistical requirements. It's all info you can get in game, of course, but that manual was something to behold way back when.",1,1

247950,Sacred 3,"This game got many negative reviews, which I find rather unfair. Sacred 3 is not Sacred or Sacred 2. It's not an RPG with an open world where you can run around and complete quests. This is what many people expected and why so many are disappointed. Sacred 3 is an extremely linear Hack'n Slash game with lots of action and (in my opinion) nice graphics. It takes place in Ancaria. That's pretty much all it has in common with its predecessors.  Nevertheless, it is a decent game. The visuals are well done, controls are intuitive (if you play with a controller) and accurate. You constantly need various buttons which are much easier to reach on a controller than a keyboard. Further, the game has a online as well as a local co-op mode. Playing with others is much more fun and something I would definitely recommend to do.  The only thing I found annoying after a while are the comments of your companions. I guess, the developers aimed at being funny. They are not. I prefer a more serious tone in the dialogues while I'm saving the world. It's not the right time to hear about wannabe romantic approaches of whatever kind of ghost I'm carrying around with me.  TL, DR: This is a good game with some minor flaws. It missed the high expectations from its loyal fans and got many undeserved bad reviews for it.",1,0

21090,F.E.A.R.,"The AI is tough, in that the soldiers will actively move around and try to kill you. In addition the main character is not too much of a super hero yet so you have roughly the same hitpoints as the soldiers you kill. It's fun, it's creepy, it's FEAR. The main game will run you 7-10 hours, EP 1 about 5 and I have not gone though EP 2 yet.   The expansions are deemed Noncanon by the company that went on to make Fear 2 and 3; Characters that die in the expansions continue to appear in the series. Though I was told if I ignore the deathes for the most part the expansions still apply.   Alma. That is the name of the creepy girl that you will see often throughout the series. Like any rage-stricken ghost her motives in the first game are completely nonsensical. Sometimes she kills good guys, sometimes badguys. Sometimes she makes things worse, sometimes better. Some times she wants to protect you, the next thing you know specters are trying to rip out your intenstines. In the first expansion pack she even seemed to be temporarily at peace after bombarding the player with hellish visions, what triggered the peace still confuses me as all the player does is traverse to the other side of a morgue.   I only have two complaints. Complaint one is: There is no contractor in the world good enough at his job not getting fired for the monstrocity that is the floor planning of every single building in Auburn. Kitchens become bathrooms become dining halls become maturnity wards and suddenly you may even drop into a sewer or elevator. This often left me disjointed and confused in terms of what direction I should be going even though I never seemed to get stuck enough to warrant a walkthrough. FEAR Obeys 90's shooter laws. Climbing into Vents is often a brilliant and eerily safe idea, side rooms typically have loot, and red valves are usable.   Second complaint. It's hinted throughout the game that the Point Man is more or less safe from Alma's outbursts. Of course she can and will kill you a few times but she has her reasons. But this seriously undermines her presence after completing FEAR and moving on to the first expansion. The second expansion and Fear 2 have a different protagonist so this is more of a gripe about expansion 1's design.",1,0

234330,Marvel Puzzle Quest,"It's a trap! All and all don't waste your money and time on this game, it's just too random. Play for free or only use money to unlock roster slots. Never ever pay to upgrade one star characters.  The monetization of this game is frustrating. Unlocking characters and powers are one and the same and come from a random event called recruiting. You roll the dice to get a character power, if you don't already have that character, they are added to your roster. So even when you are lucky enough to grab a rare three star character they are useless until you unlock their other powers which is extremely improbable. Also unlocking levels of abilities is over priced. Unlocking a single ability level on a three star character can cost (1250 points) ~$10 per level. To compete in multiplayer challenges you need rare characters who can exceed level 50. With that said, I'm hooked, hundreds of hours.... I can't get out.",-1,0

An ultraviolent neon nightmare, Hotline Miami is punishing and lenient at once; death is incredibly easy, but you can get right back to cathartic Mafiya slaughter without missing a step. You can play as cautiously or recklessly as you want, though one approach or another may work better for different levels. The plot is as gritty, twisty and trippy like a cocaine bender. But even if you lose the thread, or if you weren't able to find it in the first place, don't worry that much. You can still have plenty of fun just painting the flourescent hotspots of 80's Miami red with Russian gore.",1,0

383870,Firewatch,"Stunningly pretty with a soothing soundtrack this is overall a good feel-good game with some mystery to it. It was even a little bit scary at one point. If you like a sort of simple story with some nice hiking in it, then this might be the game for you.   Pros    Extremely pretty    Good soundtrack    Refreshing storytelling with living characters   Cons    Somewhat short for the pricerange    Linear gameplay (movement etc)    Also a linear storyline, atleast I got a feeling of not being able to change much   All in all the game left me with a nice feeling after a somewhat open ending, wanting to know how it all played out for the characters involved. Sort of like wanting more after watching a good movie.   Id have to say Im somewhat surprised to find myself paying for a singleplayer game. But Im even more surprised that even though I felt it was a little bit short for the price, I would definitely buy it again. All in all a well made product well deserving of the asking price.

278620,TinyKeep,"It has been hard for me to find good Roguelikes that can capture my attention as much as The Binding of Isaac has. Most of the time I am left with a sense of wanting or feel like the game doesn't have enough to it to make me want to play it more, But TinyKeep is one that I plan to play for quite a while.  It's biggest advantage is it procedurally generated environments, which I feel most in not all Roguelikes need. While each level of the dungeon has the same ultimate goal, the traps, rooms and enemies are always different. One playthrough might have you dealing with more archers, while hte next could have you dealing with more barabrians. And that's just the tip of the iceburg!  The game boasts a unique leveling system, or at least unique in the sense that you don't really gain XP. instead, certain enemies and environment items from coins which you can exchange for enhancements to your character at specific alters placed in the map. There's always one at the end of hte dungeon, so you can save up until you get to it, or you can find the secondary one hidden somewhere. The second one costs much more in coin, but usually gives much better buffs because of it.  It's not extrememly challenging when you're faced with only a few opponents, but soon more traps nad enemies appear, giving you less room to run, and that's when it gets tense and fun. I'd highly reccomend this to anyone who likes The Binding of Isaac or any other good Roguelike and wants to try something new.",1,0

307050,Shan Gui,"Shan Gui is probably the most lacking visual novel I've read so far. The whole thing can be read in less than two hours which is criminally low for any visual novel, it has literally no plot or interesting dialogue of any kind, and the art isn't entirely interesting. There are only two major characters that make up this visual novel, and neither of them are very interesting or charsimatic, and the environmental education that He Jia would bring up seemed way too forced, even including Wikipedia links to the sights depicted, which is just unnatural for any visual novel and ruins the little immersion it even had. I would not recommend this to anyone unless you're an aspiring developer who needs an example of how not to do a visual novel. It wasn't worth the two bucks I spent, and throwing in the forgetable sound track for free doesn't help make it any more worthwhile.  *Update* Make that the second most lacking visual novel I've read, Carpe Diem is much worse.",-1,1
57680,The First Templar,"Got it on sale for $3, still wishing I hadn't made that stupid decision of dumping 3 bucks on this one. I believe most of my frustrations about this game have already been covered by older reviews, but I'm still gonna rant about it for the heck of it anyway. First off, the graphics leave a lot of room for improvements, nothing special, generic and plain, although at times it can look kinda pretty, hit and miss mostly. Characters look funny, though this can be a matter of opinion, and they move in an awkward manner as if someone glued a giant board to their backs. As an avid fan of open world game, this game dissuaded me from playing due to its linear gameplay, you don’t have the luxury of going wherever the heck you want. Combat is forgettable and unimpressive.  Though I can tolerate some of the stated flaws, my main beef with the game is the control. REVERSE MOUSE CONTROL. And the game doesn’t even have an option to change that. “Oh, you’d like to see where you’re going? How about we show you the ceiling instead? Isn’t the sky just lovely today?” Simply put, you point up, the screen goes down and vice versa. I was struggling with it and it felt like most of my effort in playing this game went into maintaining a proper field of view. On a side note, when I finally got somewhat used to the stupid control, I went back to playing other games with NORMAL mouse control and it all went bananas for me as once again I had to struggle to revert to how I used to play those game before I had to adapt to the clunky control of this game.  Can’t say anything about the plot because I haven’t gotten very far in as evidenced by my playing time and because everything about this game just discourages me completely. My advice, don’t waste your money on it even on a sale, and if you’ve made the mistake that I did? Don’t repeat my mistake of wasting time with it. Bury it in your backlog.",-1,0

369200,NA,"If you are a Ghost in the Shell enthusiast, COD fanboy, or a squeeling twelve year old, do not read this review.  Before we jump into this review, let's take a look at how past F2P FPS games turned out that was developed and sponsored by Korean companies with idiotic developers.  CrossFire: -Trashcan place filled with 'pros' running around with VIP weapons that cost $100 each. Combat Arms: -People still play this game? Special Forces: -Reference to CrossFire F.E.A.R Online: -Do I need to explain this one?  Okay, let's dive into the review.  Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex is another generic F2P FPS that I have no doubt that Nexon will monopolize into a cash cow like it did with its previosu title &lt;&lt;Combat Arms&gt;&gt; after beta. The game makes a good impression on launch, excellent graphics, voice acting and controls. The tutorial is straight forward and teaches you everything you need to know about how to play an FPS. The game's mechanics allows you to feel like the individual characters from the classic anime and is nothing short of amazing.  With a history of making their games grindy, NEXON is seems reluctant to make their FPS games more efficient by making the process of earning GP in game an incredibly lengthy process. Costing about 200-250k for a gun, it would take many hours for you to be able to obtain a gun from the in game market. This is not a god damn RPG, its an FPS, we or at least I, don't want to grind matches so I can get one gun.  Another area of concern is the high probability that of this game turning into a P2W mess where premium guns are shoved in your face everytime you open the market. ('Buy me, I'll make you OP') Given previous NEXON games, this probably will happen....  Ahem, anyways in conclusion, if you are into FPS games in general, you'll find enjoyment in this game like I did in the 48 minutes I played this game, but soon that enjoyment will die off as the grind takes over. The game will get repetitive and the lack of skillplay will eventually drive away all the players like all the games I have mentioned above. In the end I guess what I'm saying is: 'Nexon, please make player progression easier, and for god sakes don't let this turn into another CrossFire or Combat Arms'.",-1,1

For the 2 hours I've played so far, I'd say if it's what you're into, go for it. Maybe not worth $20, but nonetheless a great game.   IMPORTANT: For potential buyers, this RPG is NOTHING like Skyrim, Gothic, or any other popular third or first-person RPG's on the market. This game is grid-based (your character moves on an invisible grid), there are MANY puzzles and the combat is not simply point-and-click. It's still a great game, but appeals to a slightly different audience.",1,0

248820,Risk of Rain,"At first glance, Risk of Rain seems like the perfect game for me. I love indie titles, I love pixelated art and I love roguelike games and this fits neatly into all of the above. Add to that a wonderful soundtrack and some, given its art style, pretty stunning visuals I almost don't see where it can go wrong.  And then it does. This game is hard. And don't get me wrong, I like plenty of difficult games. And the problem isn't even the fact that it's hard in itself, but WHY this game is hard. This game is hard because the controls are absolutely and perfectly counter-intuitive. I can barely get past stage 1 most of the time, and I've not even once gone past stage 2, simply because my fingers are tripping over each other and I keep forgetting which of four arbitrarily ordered keys does what. Frankly it's a terrible mess and changing hotkeys doesn't really help.  Another huge glaring issue is the fact that THERE IS NO MOUSE SUPPORT. Even if we skip the fact that this game obviously would have benefited greatly from mouse aim and accept that our space soldiers are so crippled they can only ever shoot horizontally; I am in possession of a gaming mouse. Not a particularly expensive once, but a gaming mouse all the same. If I were allowed to allocate hotkeys to mouse keys, my enjoyment in playing this game would increase drastically. When you have a sort of standard attack that can be performed over and over with no penalties, akin to a standard or auto-attack, binding it to mouse 1 is pretty freaking intuitive. Why the devs tried to come up with their own weird standard of how these games are supposed to be mapped to keys is beyond me. Also, how you can release a game, for the PC, in 2014 without mouse support is just mind-boggling. If I were one of the devs I probably wouldn't be able to sleep at night due to such a horrendous oversight.  To be fair, I could probably get used to the controls in this game. I could probably spend hours upon hours, dying over and over in the first few levels, just to get a hang of the basic controls in a adequate manner. But I wouldn't have fun doing it. And then, why should I? I bought this game alongside another similar game, Teleglitch, and I'm halfway into the game without having died once and the worst experience I had in that title was that I had to look up a particular hotkey once. Outside of that, it has been smooth sailings and the controls came to me perfectly intuitively. I don't feel like I have to do battle with weird key assignments and bad controller design. I can just get busy PLAYING THE GAME. Whenever I play Risk of Rain, my activity is CONSTANTLY interrupted by the fact that I have to look down on my keyboard to see what keys I'm even pressing and my own rising anger and dissapointment with how counter-intuitive the whole thing is.  I hope, somehow, the devs for Risk of Rain sees this. The difficulty of a game should be based on learning strategies to better succeed and improving how you control the game through experience. Imagine how stupid it would be to have a game where the only difficult part of the game was that all the controls were randomized constantly or that the controls were simply inversed to what you're used to so up is down etc. That's not in any way whatsoever a meaningful difficulty to overcome. To feel that a game is probably really fun and not at all so difficult as it needs to be is kind of like having the game not letting you play it. Whenever I died, it's not because of an enemy that I didn't know how to beat or that I was too slow to react or anthing like that. My knowledge and reactions were fine, the interface was not. And that is really frustrating.  It's rather ironic that the stated third goal the devs had with this game is. ' Be enjoyable, regardless of whether you win or lose. No more fussing with complex and non-intuitive gameplay patterns. Players should not blame the game for their loss!' which is exactly what's going on here. When the only reason I lost is because of counter-intuitive controls, I blame the game, and rightly so because it's a loss through no fault of mine.",-1,0

507360,NA,"Not bad. Could use some background music. This game takes me back to my early days of gaming and first discovering Rogue-Likes (though I didn't know that name yet) by playing Fatal Labyrinth on the Sega Genesis (with annoying background music, so it could be worse!). I fell in love with the formula of random dungeons with random items, random layouts, etc. One playthrough you might get lucky on good items. Or you might die after only a few floors.   There have been a lot of Rogue-likes over the years, and some people are picky about what aspects they like and don't like. So let's take a look and see if this game fits your Rogue-like bill.  1. Random floor layouts (square rooms with corridors and sometimes dead ends) 2. Fog of War (Everything is black except a small area around you. The floor lights up as you walk and stays lit.) 3. Need to find Food (as you take your steps through the dungeon floors your food level drops and you get hungry. Find food items and eat them to regain your food level) 4. HP replenishes automatically by walking (Yay! But don't waste too much time getting your health back because you might get hungry!) 5. Turn-Based (Nothing happens until you take a step, or you can skip a step if you need a monster to approach so you get first hit instead of it. Monsters won't move until you move. I don't know if using an item takes a move or not.) 6. You can save your game and return later! Very cool.  7. Nice graphics for 2D pixel style game.  8. Sounds effects, but no background music (so far) 9. Permadeath? I'm assuming, but have not died yet. 10. Keyboard or Gamepad (I used keyboard, so don't know how good the gamepad controls are) 11. ??? Something I missed or can't remember? Let me know!  My verdict (so far): I love the old-school look. All the points above hit my buttons, so I'm very happy. Looking forward to more playing and will update if I learn something interesting.  *** Update ***  There are traps on the ground. Sometimes you can see the outline of them. There is a spell scroll that will reveal them. Ones I have encountered: Damage traps (fire, etc.), Teleport Trap (moves you to random location on same floor, Healing Trap (it heals you!), and I think there was one that dropped me down a few floors.   Lots of different enemy types: Undead (skeleton, lich); Fire (fire snake, cloaked fire guy); Ice (Blue Cloaked Guy--sorry I can't remember the name); Slimes; Minotaur; Rival Adventurers (loot their gear!); Frog; Thing with Eyeballs; and Dragons! That's all I can remember of the top of my head. I should really write this stuff down!  It seemed easy at first but I didn't make it to the bottom. I ran out of food and died! :-( Save your food, people!  Oh, and limited Inventory. You can you have 6 items, in addition to your weapon and armor. That's it, just 6! Decide wisely what to carry and what to leave.  Monster Room! Just before I died I encountered a different sort of floor. Just a small room filled with monsters, and tons of great loot in a room beyond.",1,0

110800,L.A. Noire,"LA Noire appears to be an open-world game in the style of the Grand Theft Auto, but really it's a hard-boiled crime saga following the career of Cole Phelps, newly minted detective of Los Angeles.  Set in the mid-1940's, you and your partner will be given cases based in real events of the time. You'll examine crime scenes, find evidence, and speak to witnesses as part of your investigations. Questioning folk is easily the best part of the game!  Team Bondi's ground-breaking technology allows actors' perfomances to be integrated almost flawlessly into the game, giving characters an astonishing range of emotion and nuance. Using this, along with your deductions from evidence, your job is tell when people are lying. And it is not easy to catch a crooked politician in a lie!  All in all, LA Noire is an experience. The attention to detail that went into it is grand. making it almost flawless. There are some control issues, and occasional face glitches, but not enough to ruin anything",1,0

17430,NA,"About 5+ years ago, I got this on release, and played this on Xbox 360. I hated it. I absolutely thought it was the worst game that could have ever been produced.  Recently I bought this at a Steam sale, thinking that I might as well just put down my $5 into some random cheap racing game, hoping it would provide even an hours entertainment. I'm so happy with this purchase. I regret my constant stream of hate.  Granted, this is definately not the pinnicle of NFS (Underground 2/Most Wanted 2005 will always be), and that's clear through some poor design desicions regarding the lack of a main menu, the fact you can't change graphics quality until you actually get to play the game (about 5 minutes of cutscenes), and even the fact that there's too much bloom and there's some weird glitches with the lights floating a la Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing.  But, with all the negatives said and done, this...this is the most fun I've had in a racing game in years. It seems like the devs tried to be as faithful as they could to Most Wanted, while still moving forward with the rest of the game. The cars control FANTASTICALLY on PC compared to console, and the selection of vehicles is awesome, especially considering the Bugatti Veyron (which, gladly thanks to the Master Events balancing the field, isn't game-breaking). The length of the game is awesome, with a huge amount of things to do. The police chases are fantastic, and polished much further than Most Wanted (admittadely though, I'll always prefer the down-right hilariously poor AI of Most Wanted's cops, and their over-the-top voice acting).  Overall, this really probably didn't recieve a lot of the backlash it got from fans. If you're a Most Wanted fan who has been disillusioned with the Need for Speed franchise as of late, you can do no harm in buying this game and reliving a time just before Criterion broke everything. And before The Run existed...",1,1

273960,Mechs & Mercs: Black Talons,"This is one of those games that looks really good, only when you play do you realize how much potential was wasted. I adore the warhammer 40k series and XCOM which are two of my favorite series. When I saw this game I though I might enjoy it for the strategy and persistent squad aspect. However, this game from what Ive found is a zergfest. If your infantry arent moving together its easy to lose squads.   The enemies you face always seem to know where you are and have unlimited resources. With this taken into consideration if you try to move tactically and flank opponents you'll find that your units become over extended and are taken out which causes frustration.  This game could have really been something with a couple tweaks, but it falls short.   With all that taken into account, I find that this game isnt completely horrible. The cutscenes are great and the setting is awesome. Running a stranded merc company and fighting your way out inadvertantly winning back a sector for its people is a great plot. I cant really say anything about the characters, because from my experience they arent really fleshed out. This game is a fun zerg, but with the way the AI attacks it kills any strategy you could think of.  I will say this, if you enjoy strategy games and this is on sale, get it, if not forget it.  -Reghs",-1,1

22330,The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion,"Played this after Skyrim, which I guess is 'wrong' to do by some standards, so for anybody who was interested in Morrowind/Oblivion after playing Skyrim can maybe appreciate my insight here to at least compare the two (I've yet to play Morrowind, I'm so backwards).  Skyrim was a fantastic game, but the whole dragon prophecy approach you can only do so much with (and dragon combat was kind of pathetic), and Oblivion feels a lot more creatively driven-- the oblivion gates are really neat and good areas to get some combat experience. I like that you can kind of take a lot of approaches in this, stealth feels just as powerful as all-out warrior combat where I felt rogues were underpowered in Skyrim. (The whole, shoot-arrow-and-cower-in-the-shadows approach could get a little tedious and became more than necessary as a rogue after things scaled enough) In Oblivion as a more stealth-oriented class, my movement speed allows me to dodge and bait enemy attacks and then strike after dodging the blow, and illusion spells combo wonderfully.  Also, you can choose main specs that affect your level, so leveling non-combat things doesn't completely screw you over. I remember my lockpick had gotten me high in level in Skyrim and I was fighting things that completely outgeared and outdamaged me because my  combat  levels were low, but in Oblivion their leveling system is more specific and you can avoid that problem easily. Though, the scaling is global and REAL, so expect to run into bandits with daedric weapons at some point. You'll probably be strong enough by then though, so it's just good gold if you can carry their stuff.  Overall, an awesome game in my opinion, lots of hours of gameplay and playing it lets you appreciate the plot of Skyrim a little bit more, personally experiencing the history that you were told about in Skyrim.   PROS: - A really awesome main story - Tons of gameplay hours that Bethesda games love to offer - Guild/faction playthroughs show an interesting perspective on Skyrim's same guild/factions - Balanced combat system - Narrowed-down leveling system kept me from fighting OP enemies  CONS: - Naturally the graphics are older and some races are not done any justice - The game tends to freeze, sometimes freezing the second I load up (this wasn't bad enough to be intrusive, but I did suck my teeth many a time) - You're going to hear the same like 5 voices for the entire game (with different dialogue ofc) - Sometimes item leveling ♥♥♥♥♥ you over-- you wander by chance to a place with a great item and it's forever superweak because you discovered it at a low level - Psychic guards, nuff said",1,0

241540,State of Decay,"This is the zombie game I've been waiting for. The open world environment, resource management, morale, and maintenance of outposts and safe houses creates a more 'survivor' atmosphere. It feels like I'm actually working hard to survive in a post-apocalyptic world filled with zombie.  It is like an Elder Scrolls gameplay style mixed with some The Sims mechanics. The mechanic of having missions timed puts just the right amount of pressure on you to give weight to your choices.  The driving is a bit floaty, though. I never liked having the walk forward button also be the drive forward button. Slight touches of the controls can send the car flying in that direction. There was also one incident where I drove through the horde, tried to stop after I passed them, and had my car flip forward on nothing. That was weird, funny, and annoyting at the same time.  I do appreciate the fact that cars handle differently, though. I have played too many games where what car you pick out doesn't really matter.  Other than the wonky driving, everything is excellent.

While that's a big complaint of mine, it's really my only complaint. The game is really fun to play, especially with a group of friends and it has a lot of cool characters and cutscenes. You start out with one free hero from a set list and the rest you have to buy with in-game money or real-life money if you're impatient lol.

236870,HITMAN™,"At the time of this review I have completed the training missions, and Paris mission and I am currently working my way through 2nd episode.  I am writing this review as a huge fan of Blood Money, I also enjoyed Hitman Absoultion, although I felt Absolution was less of a Hitman game and more of an action adventure stealth story driven game. This game, feels like Hitman, huge levels, multiple ways to approach your victims, multiple pieces of gear to use on a mission, and the opportunies system is an interesting way of interjecting even more stragety into your game.  The episodic release, at first I was skeptical of, but honestly, I do not mind it, gives them time to make the missons as fleshed out and realized as they possibly can. Also if you are like me and do not want to drop 60 bucks on the game and want to try it out, just buy episode 1 and give it a go, play under 2 hours and return it if it's not your bag. Or worst case scenario, you play for more than two hours at least you aren't commited to the other episodes.  I cannot speak for contracts mode as I have yet to try it, and have not done one yet. Move onto another review if you need more information on contracts.  I will also say that the game requires some muscle to run. Break out your high end 4gb or higher graphics cards. The game is locked on low textures if you only have a 2 gig card.  If you were a fan of Blood Money but felt as if Absoultion was too far off the path then welcome home Agent 47.",1,0

550,Left 4 Dead 2,"Left 4 Dead 2 is the best zombie fps game i have ever played (next to Dead Island though i perfer this more) I can only find a few things wrong (about 2 or 4). The Things i like the most are the survivors they all have good personalitys and funny lines time to time (my most favorite survivor is Ellis), the weapons are pretty fun (be it a bit over powered in easy) the special infected are pretty gross looking, the gore has been ramped up (and for the better), and MOST of the campaigns are fun (with one exception). Lastly Mutations are a good way to shake up the game. The things wrong with this are the bots really care only about them selves only being there to get you to the end (but this can be fixed with one mod). The Swamp Fever campaign isn't really all that fun. Advanced and Expert are almost impossible even with friends. Scavenge isn't the best game mode for a 4v4. Overall this is a fun zombie fps game (and with the correct mods this can be one of the most realistic zombie games) with its special infected the vairety of game modes and everything else i mentioned this is well worth the 20 dollars.

44350,GRID 2,"GRID 2 feels awfully patronizing. It's full of talky people who drone on and on about your next event. Hey, Mr. Sponsor guy, or whoever you are? I get it. It's a racing game. I need to race the other people and get first place. Codemasters (the developers) tries to space all of the talky bits out so that you're doing things in between some dingus blabbing in your earpiece, but then, Codemasters also included a tutorial that feels the need to break down the very concept of a race, as if you were going to play this game having never understood what the goal of racing was. I was halfway expecting to get a tutorial on what an accelerator is supposed to do, to be honest.   If you can get past all of that waste of breath, this is your standard Codemasters racing game: beautiful visuals, not-quite-simulation-but-good-enough driving physics, and some pretty dang intense racing with great damage modeling. As of writing this review, I've only played it for a little under an hour, but I can already tell exactly what kind of game this is, because I've played three others just like it, and I am definitely in for this one.   If only everyone in the single player mode would stop trying to chat my ear off about this 'World Series of Racing' nonsense. Stop talking about driving and just let me drive!",1,0

296970,Renowned Explorers: International Society,"This game has not sold enough copies!  It's a great little tactics game in which you gather a band of 3 explorers to travel to different countries and find riches and fame. In each place, you'll progress by going from one encounter to the next (similar to FTL) until you reach the final encounter in which you can gain the main treasure of the place. During all this you have to manage your resources (food) and the progression of your characters to get strong enough for the specific encounters. If it comes to a fight, you'll be thrown into a turn-based tactics game with pretty strong mechanics (despite the harmless look).   One playthrough takes only about 1-2 hours and you are encouraged to try different locations or a different set of adventurers. That said, all in all, I'd like to see a bit more variety and more options, especially when it comes to the locations.   All this is set in a lovely and fun scenery with a great art style and a cute sense of humour. I can only heartily recommend this little gem of a game.",1,0

This game is a good game to get creeped out and spooked at the same time, but it does have its flaws in my opinion. The major flaw I found was that the jumpscares were very predictable and I found myself left more bored than scared, though this was not a major problem for me, but it could be for some people and it really didn't matter because the edge I got when I was hiddening and sneaking around really made up for it, but thats entirely based on the person and some might find it doesn't make the game any better. Over all Outlast is a good horror game, but its at no level at the level of my favorite horror game, that being Amensia: The Dark Descent which really made me feel scared.",1,0
92300,A.R.E.S.,"How did it all go so wrong? You had decades of platformers to look back on to get it right. This is not a bad game per sé, but I could find faults with nearly every aspect of it without trying.  As hommage to Megaman (I presume), your starting suit is  bad . That's fine as you get the better suit quickly, but the weapon upgrades are something else. I only upgraded the Wave Emitter because a gun shooting through walls seemed OP. It is, and incredibly so. It made the game completely trivial until the last boss (where it still seemed to outperform all other guns by a long shot), and the SMG seemed similarly powerful.  Difficulty comes in 2 forms: surprise attacks (mobs that will charge at you as you enter the next screen, you'll quickly learn to zone with attack held down) and the lack of a second thumb on your right hand that would allow you to jump while firing. The controls are...it's hard to describe, it feels like there is some sort of weird animation-lock that prevents you from turning around/jumping as soon as you'd expect to be able to (which is awful in a game designed with heavy slide usage in mind) after firing. Example situation as I have witnessed it: I'm firing at something to my right, I'm on the left edge of a platform, the next higher one is up to the left. I fire, press and hold left and press jump. Character fires, turns around, walks off the edge. This can be reproduced 100% of the time, I'm not sure how this got through. Sure, you could say 'so you walk off a platform, big deal', but what if the platform is a laserbeam and my attempt to jump is an attempt to slide through it, but instead I get hit (this situation brought to you by the final boss)? These are real situations, and they make the game quite annoying.  Grenades seem kind of tacked on and pointless until you get the unlimited grenades-upgrade, you only need to grenade-jump very occasionally and the other weapons are so strong that you don't need grenades for combat. Speaking of 'tacked on', the crafting system also seems pretty redundant. It's not too painful, and it allows you to farm healthpacks, but you could always farm lives in these sort of games, so it's nothing really new (which is fine).  The boss patterns are very simple. I don't play these sort of games that often, yet I don't think I needed more than 2 attempts on any boss except the last one (on Hard). In fact, I think I oneshot all but 1 and the last boss boss on my first run.  The last boss is a three phase fight, and presented the only real challenge in the game for me. Sadly, however, this was mostly because of the bad boss(-room) design and phasing. The bottom left and right platforms regularly get you stuck (due to the ramp underneath), the big yellow laser orb has a larger hitbox than is visually apparent (I must have gotten hit by that about 20 times when it clearly didn't touch me), and if there are projectiles out on the screen when the boss phases, you will be rooted in place and take the projectiles in the mouth as there is nothing you can do about it. Mechanically the boss was somewhat challenging and fun otherwise, though still only what you'd expect in other games on Normal difficulty.  Overall, A.R.E.S: E.A. is a very short (~2.5 hours for first playthrough) and easy platformer with Twin-Stick shooting (please tag the game accordingly!), little innovation and many flaws. This is the kind of game you will best enjoy if you want to replay and master it (and you will have to if you want the achievements). For a one-time playthrough it is utterly unremarkable, but the upgrades from the first playthrough persist and make replaying it a somewhat appealing proposition.  With as little choice as we have on Steam for Megaman-like games, it's an okay buy. If I had to give it a rating, I'd say 6/10.",-1,0

244210,Assetto Corsa,"Shaun Cole was right all along, this is an arcade racing game. Don't be fooled by PR talk or fanboys, this is no SIM race title, and it never will be, think a cross between the Forza series and the Gran Turismo series, but without the fun of having many many cars and tracks... Truth be told, it is abit of a bad joke that this is branded as a 'next gen' SIM, much like how Gran Turismo is marketed as 'The ultimate driving simulator'   - engine supports only 1 light source = this game will never feature night time driving... - changeable weather? i haven't seen any in any case... - no timed racing, only option is to set x amount of laps - no rubbering in of the track - no damage model - press escape during an online race, and you end back in the pits with a new car, ready to go out (and wreck) again - tyre model? i doubt it - ridiculously small amount of input options - community - BIGGEST deal breaker: racing online, when someone finishes it sets off a timer, if you don't cross the finish within that time, your screen just goes black and are taken to the results page TAKING AWAY ANY INCENTIVE to even start a race !! what's the bloody point in driving x amount of laps on any track, if you can't finish your race because you are not in P1 ?? Or close to him?   All in all, nothing in the game is geared towards beeing a racing SIM, eyecandy and stupid showrooms are the order of the day in this title, wich is fine if you are looking for that kinda of game (and don't have an Xbox to buy the much superior forza series), but not so much when you are duped into thinking this is a propper SIM.  background: 10years + of SIM racing on titles as FIA GTR, Rfactor, FIA GTR2 and Rfactor2",-1,0
22200,Zeno Clash,"xeno-   prefix.  from Ancient Greek ξένος ( ksénos , “alien”) a. Having to do with foreigners, as in xenophilia, or more commonly, xenophobia. b. From a foreign place, as in xenolith.   clash   noun.  onomatopoeic a. A skirmish, a hostile encounter. b. Opposition, contradiction, such as between differing or contending interests, views, purposes etc.  In my imagination, the development of  Xeno -- sorry,  Zeno Clash  -- started when folks at Ace Team got together, got high, and got onto the subject of ancient mythologies (Roman, Greek, Norse, etc.) and how weird they all were. I mean, if you want crazy characters and crazier stories, you need look no further than some of the gods and goddesses traipsing around back in the day. Athena, birthed fully formed out of the sweaty forehead of Zeus; Pan, the goat-god of wanton sex; Artemis, goddess of the hunt, who for some reason was depicted in various interpretations as being  literally covered with breasts ; Medusa, she of the stylish snake perm and stony gaze, being some kind of metaphor for psychosexual wackiness (I'm pretty sure we can blame Freud for that); Jeff, the God of Biscuits; and even some nutter who told people to eat some bread and drink some wine and pretend it was his flesh and his blood... I mean, ew, dude. I'm sure we have enough problems without adding cannibalism to it. So anyway, the developers were shooting the breeze about Gods and Golden Fleece and rivers of blood and whatever until one guy, as I imagine it, stood up and went, 'Yeah... but like, what if... Dude! What if there were, like, aliens, right? And they were weird, like totally, heh, but then, like, THEY also had myths and ♥♥♥♥! I mean...  dude ...'  So that's where this game comes from, more or less. There is a distinct dreamlike quality inherent in the stories of myth, fantastical and larger than life, and that is the feeling you get as you find your way through the land of Zenozoik. It feels deliciously alien and new, in the visuals and in the story (neither of which go out of their way to make a lot of sense, but it's still easy enough to follow). You'll see and hear a lot of weird stuff, and sooner or later, you just go with the flow because it's weirdly seductive. Even running on the old Source engine, and looking a bit dated now in 2015, the art and design and imagination of the dev team comes through in nearly every area so that you will truly think you are in fact running around on an impossibly, impossibly alien world. Luckily, they do at least have one thing in common with us here on Earth: they really like punching the stuffing out of each other.  If you've seen anything about  Zeno Clash  you already know the basics: it's a first-person brawler-shooter. Way more emphasis on the brawling than the shooting, thankfully. You, a fugitive on the run, have a modest set of fighting moves at your disposal, such as light and strong punches, blocks, dodges, counterattacks, grabs and throws. Unfortunately, so do your opponents for the most part, although they will also attack you at range if they get a chance. You get a small selection of weapons yourself, and they come in handy once in a while but the majority of your combat will be served in knuckle sandwiches. And they were never so tasty: combat feels fantastic in this game. It's fun, responsive and fast, with a good amount of variety (though there could be more), and it's super satisfying to land an uppercut on some chump and watch him go flying. I didn't really think I'd enjoy such a melee-focused FPS but after playing this I stand corrected, it's ridiculously fun. I even enjoyed the few bits where you are required to tote a rifle or another firearm, although I am glad those bits were few. They're not bad, really -- the rifle in particular sounds great, and it's amusing to plunk away at dudes with the double-fisted handguns -- but save for a couple spots you won't really get that much of a chance to use them because enemies will do their best to rush you if you're shooting at them, and none of the weapons are viable at close quarters.  One thing you will notice right off the bat is the voice acting, and it is... hmm. How to describe it. Well, your first impression will probably be 'Oh my god this is bad.' And you wouldn't really be wrong, especially with regards to the main character. He is, let's say, from the same acting school as Christopher Walken and William Shatner, only he flunked out hard. His lines are awkwardly paced, and weirdly inexpressive; he speaks in a stilted, matter-of-fact tone. All of that might turn you off -- which is why I'm mentioning it -- but honestly, his weirdness actually fits the game very well. There is often dialogue that sounds so insane on paper, but because of the way he delivers his lines, it instead sounds believable and ordinary, which makes the bizarre setting of the game even more bizarre. All in all, it works for me. It may not work for you.  It's not a very long game (ignore my obscenely long playtime), but it's a fully-formed, enjoyable, weird as all hell story that will have you doing at least one or two double-takes because you have probably never heard sentences like these in a game before. The fighting is hard and fast and so enjoyable, the world is filled with delicious weirdness for your eyes, and the trusty Source engine shines through even for a six year old game. I don't know about you, but it absolutely charmed the pants off me with how little Ace Team cared for making the 'right' game, and made a fun, unique, and beautifully bizarre one instead.",1,1

343360,Particula,"I am not a fan of tower defense or even strategy games, in general. I got this game on a bundle, and I was glad I got it, though, as the game has a characteristic that is not usually related to tower defense games: it's a relaxing game, a game about keeping it cool while fighting balls of energy that symbolize all the things that can ruin our lives.  The game lacks a tutorial (only has a brief screen explanating the keys required to play. There is no story mode, only different scenarios and in-game achievements, most of them being related to playing the game once in a higher difficulty level. The music is soothing, and the sound effects are really nice and fit the game really well.   Gameplay consists of creating units to defend your mind from the negative forces, and you can upgrade these units using the game's currency, that is, the energy you get by destroying the negative forces. There is no explanation of the advantages of each unit, but a basic rule to play the game is be to keep removing old units as soon as possible and adding better ones, until you only have the best units. Then you need to upgrade the units to be faster (up to 2s between shots) and deal more damage (not sure if there is a limit to the damage per shot for each unit), and these upgrades also cost energy.  I have not been able to play in multiplayer, as the game found no servers at the time. I will update this review if I'm able to play with someone, in the future, but the game page tells me up to three people can play at a time, and it is also possible to chat with other players, even if you are playing alone (I don't know why this is an option).  To sum up, I do recommend the game, but I must warn you that you will not have much to do in it, unless you really want to get all the in-game achievements or just need a game to play when you need to relax for some time. However, due to the lack of story, I can only recommend it if you get it in a really good sale or in a bundle (I believe a game should be reviewed as worth playing regardless of the price, as Steam has countless sales and indie games appear in countless bundles).",1,1

244450,Men of War: Assault Squad 2,"Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is a good and solid WWII strategy game. The campaign is solid, clear and fun and so are multiplayer games.  One big thing is that you can actually use mods in Multiplayer mode to spice things up a little. You can make basically sandbox multiplayer games where everyone spawns in huge armies and just starts this huge battle. Perfect for re-enactments too.  Graphics-wise the game is not really standing out, but it's definately not bad either. The interface of the menu's, mostly the main menu look like it was made in 1998, which kinda scares you until you start playing the game itself.  Another big advantage is the large amount of units you can build. The game is often compared to Company of Heroes, but it's gameplay differs mostly in the fact thay in Men of War: Assault Squad 2, you don't need to make any buildings to get progress. Also, you get to your unit capacity much quicker than in Company of Heroes, this can be solved with mods though.  There is one MAJOR drawback (depending on how you see it) though: The Soviet Union. There was one game where I played with my friend (Mreetbaar12) and he was playing as the US army and I had the Soviet Red army. He had a whole army just absolutely slaughtering me. I was getting points by just waiting until I had enough for buying an IS-1...  Well, he had like 8 tanks just killing all my soldiers before. I sent my IS-1 to his army, it barely took any damage and his whole army got absolutely wrecked. I ended up just putting it next to his spawn point and just spawnkilling everything he brought in. Even tank destroyers were useless. He thought I was cheating, but afterwards we both found out that the Soviet tanks are just EXTREMELY OP. This is fun for the one playing the Soviet Union, but can be very frustrating for the other players.  Aside from that, if nobody picks the Soviet Union, other countries are more balanced to eachother. The US army can beat Germans at even chances and so can the British armies.  Short recap:  + Solid Campaign + Lots of different strategies possible + Lots of units + Descent graphics + Mods can be used in Multiplayer + Multiplayer works well  - Soviet Union very stronk - Main menu looks very old - Unit cap without mods   I can recommend this game to anybody who likes strategy games, but just keep in mind everything I said. I like the game, but it has some nasty disadvantages. Over all, I'd give this game a 8/10.",1,0

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"Huge Treyarch fan, and I'm pleased with this game. I don't buy any Infitiward titles as I see them as boring.   CONS: Now for the actual review, I'll be unbiased, now I'm disappointed with Treyarch's direction on going sci-fi. Many people along with myself, don't recognize the Call of Duty franchise anymore. It's trying to becoming something its not. That is the same thing here. It's disappointing really.  The game used to run horrible for the longest time, where I'd get 90FPS on max settings, now I get 130-135FPS, it took too long to optimize the game.  Even though I didn't finish the story line, it doesn't seem too interesting or unique. Just the same old, same old...  PROS: If you're into Zombies with your friends, or looking to buy this game for its massively played multiplayer, than I recommend it. Overall, if you're in it for its multiplayer perks, buy it. If you're looking to buy it for the story line, than why are you here?",1,0

294860,Valkyria Chronicles™,"This is a Wonderful PC port of a game I've already poured hours into but wanted to do it again, control scheme is wonderful, and in my opinion Valhalla Chronicles has some of the best character development and backstories ever. There are many cutscenes which may become tedious for some players who like to jump into only the action but I prefer to know at least who I'm fighting with and what I'm fighting for. My only dislike is the fact that the AI in the game won't really ever outsmart you, but you could be overrun by troops that are far too out of your league, and that feels to me like a 'bad loss' where a good loss is when you lost because of a failure to be as strategic as possible with your actions and a bad loss is one where you could replay the mission as many times as you wanted and still die, even then, the challenge missions (which I'm probably not supposed to do until a higher level because they clearly outclass me) can be won with decent strategies and some guile. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes a good, fun, story-based game, or who likes strategy games with a slightly easier learning curve to them.",1,0

Rightly so, in my opinion.  The community has since divided itself, becoming impossible to please. Every change has quite vocal detractors as a result. Many of these simply disagree with their favorite strategy getting nerfed. That said, the old 'release something OP, nerf later' method of releasing new content is in full swing.   Don't let any of this confuse you, this is one of the best games to come out in recent years. It's pleasingly difficult and complex, the sound and artwork is superb and the narrator's haunting voice is magnificent.  Pro's: - Deep and varied gameplay - Immersive atmosphere, looks great - Unique combination of mechanics, one of it's kind  Con's  - Updates may result in a sudden difficulty spike or a favorite strategy becoming unviable  Verdict: Good game, highly recommended.",1,1

On my first playthrough I only put it down when my eyes started hurting from drying out. I guess part of why it's hard to stop playing is that it has these (kind of) repetitive missions where you have to build your whole city up from scratch every time, but there's also an interesting enough storyline to make it all worthwhile.  For people who have any idea what living in communism is like, Tropico 4 is a humorous reminder with timeless quotes from Great Leaders and decisions that would be unimaginable in Western democracies while quite pedestrian in the Soviet Union.  Goodness of voice acting is worth a mention.  Would definitely watch the proletariat fulfil a 5-year-plan in 4 years again.",1,1

307010,Northmark: Hour of the Wolf,"Northmark: Hour of the Wolf is a small, role-playing game with card-based battles, set in a fantasy world that is under the threat of a mysterious force.The game comes from independent video game maker Rake in Grass, and blends the traditional exploration and quest running of role-playing games with a card-based combat system where you buff and curse units in order to change the tide of battles.  The brunt of the game is going from location to location, clicking on the hotspots on each image, getting new quests from the main characters, side missions from the tavern, new cards from the shop, and some money from the arena.The arena will provide you with the necessary gold to acquire fancy cards, with progressively difficult encounters in each new area, and secondary missions usually also offer you mainly gold, with a couple of exceptions, where you get cards or even new characters to fill the ranks of your party.The experience is mainly linear and not overly difficult, especially once you get the hang of how things work, and it sometimes borders on tedious, especially if you don't get the right attack buff cards and have to slowly chip away at an adversary's health, or wait for its defensive buff to wear off.  The cards themselves are split into several categories, direct bonuses to your attacks, buffs that give you enhanced defensive ability or offensive potential for a couple of turns, and cards that have the contrary effect on your opponents. Their power varies mostly in brute stats rather than in interesting effects, and the pool of cards is quite limited. Granted, having only 3 spots for units and 12 for battle cards makes this seem like not such a big deal, and the game is overall short enough that you don't get do play with the same deck for very long stretches.  During battle, every character gets one move that can consist of using one of their own abilities or something from your battle deck. There are no casting costs, just one card / character, which means that there is rarely any reason to use low-power cards, and you'll have all your strongest cards in your deck at all times.You goal is to get characters' attack value high enough above an enemy's defense to score as many damage points as possible, and the AI is not extremely potent, rarely focusing down your units, resulting in opponents that are pretty easy to take down, with a bit of luck.  Apart from the campaign, there is also a Quick Battle mode where you can play as any of the in-game character classes and use all the cards without having to purchase them first, which is a very nice idea, but unfortunately the lack of multiplayer is something that makes the title a little bit less appealing.  The graphics in Northmark: Hour of the Wolf are decent enough, nothing very good but not overly bad either, the drawings are generally pretty bland and will not impress in any way. That being said, they're not terrible either, and do a fine job of carrying the game, being in line with its simple nature. The music is also decent enough to work, nothing terribly engaging or epic, but not completely drab either, and just like the graphics, it's functional enough to carry the game.  Although the game starts off like a fairly fun experience, it quickly becomes apparent that Northmark: Hour of the Wolf has a few sloppy areas. The card game itself is very simplistic, and the entire game is overall very short, and its story is pretty generic, not to mention the fact that it doesn't go into a meaningful direction, in part due to its small scope. There are not many cards, not many characters, and only a modest amount of interaction, very limited deckbuilding options, for the most part you just go through the motions once you get the hang of the game, and there aren't many things that surprise you.  The story is good enough but not stellar, and, once you go through it, there is little replay value. The lack of multiplayer also cuts from the life expectancy of Northmark: Hour of the Wolf. It could have done with a stronger design focus, but it's enjoyable enough as it is, if you're looking for a casual card game with a story to tell.",1,1
319630,Life is Strange™,"I'll just answer the obvious question first and then go on my diatribe afterward:  Should you play  Life is Strange  and/or is it a good game? The answer to both versions of this question is very much a, 'Yes.'  So... I've been thinking for weeks about what I could say about  LiS  in a review that would both explain why I love the game and also avoid spoiling it for anyone that hasn't played it (or even spoil parts of it for people that have played it, but that I played differently than they did). I have come to the conclusion that there is really no point in discussing the story or the characters because they speak for themselves. Rather, I will focus on what  LiS  did that very few other games have ever managed to do (at least in my case):   Life is Strange  has the power to evoke an emotional response in you. I'm not just talking about the game making you happy or sad because any game can do that in a ham-handed sort of way; it can make you afraid, or disgusted, or hopeful, or empathetic, or even totally emotionally confused to the point that you're feeling all of those things at one time.  Telltale Games': The Walking Dead  is the only other game that has ever had a similar effect on me, and it should really come as little surprise given how similar it is to  LiS  in its' basic design philosophy.  Before I sum up, I would like to note that the game has an amazing indie-rock soundtrack and voice-acting that puts it in the top ten games of all time in that regard. Graphically,  LiS  is nothing to really write home about, but adventure games have rarely achieved the graphical fidelity of the more actiony titles ( Myst  being one of the few examples I can think of and even that was only the case back in 1993).  In the end, all I can do that will denote my very high regard for  Life is Strange  is to say that I have never wanted to replay a game more than I do in this case, but I also realize that there is no going back and to attempt to do so will only cast a pallor on what was a virtually transcendant experience. DontNod and  LiS  get my vote for  2015 Game of Year .",1,0

295790,Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna),"Beautiful visuals, light but interesting narrative, and conceptually good mechanics are hampered by frustrating and occasionally baffling control choices. The length is just about right for the game as the control mechancis never quite feel right - I played it in 3 or 4 sessions and each time I stopped it was due to being fed up with the controls.  There is also an edutainment angle, and while I haven't watched the documentaries yet, they're an appreciated bonus to the game. I do wish it was a bit more subtley integrated, seeing how consistent the rest of the presentation is.",-1,0

326650,The Legend of Candlewind,"Well, one unbelievably empty, dull, hollow piece of code. Hardly can I call it game, since it lacks content of all possible kinds: visuals (I don't remember single animation), sound, lore, story, sensible fighting &amp; leveling system... you name it. Along with bugs on every possible step, it resembles some pre-pre-pre-alpha concept of a game - and concept rather to be thrown away. It is hardly to believe someone has the 'guts' to even sell it - I would be ashamed to release it even as freeware. So much dilletantish and sloppy it is.  It hurts to be this harsh, but it hurts to play it even more.",-1,1
233980,Unepic,"Fun sidescrolling metroidvania style game with some good references and cultural humor. zoidberg runs by in a part of the game. that cracked me up as it was totally unexpected. you'll die a lot getting the hang of it until you begin using the bow or wands more at points. but the exploration is nice and the things you find like the yoda-like guy are pretty neat. character customization is very flexible you can pop the points you earn leveling up into various skills, which will determine what you can equip and use and how well as weapons had skill level requirements. some of the skills I remember being making potions, spellbooks, wands, gun-types like a laser pistol an achievement point vender sells (I think the pistol fit into the wands skill), swords, axes, the types of armor etc. it's on the monster daily very cheap so worth a grab. it also has online play, but I never tried that though I think some workshop maps are designed for it.",1,0

242860,Verdun,"I can't believe I haven't left a review for this game yet. It is a awesome WWI shooter. Don't expect to survive more than 2 hits and most of the time it is a one shot kill. Expect to die. A LOT. When you first start out you are gonna want to go gunho as most shooters will let you.   When defending, everyone lines up on the trench to drop anyone charging forward to stop them from capturing. Expect to sit in a trench for a long time killing people as bodies fill the trench.   When attacking, expect the same treatment from your enemies. You need to hop from crater to crater to make it to their trenches to capture it. If you fail to capture it in time, you will need to retreat in time so you aren't executed. The game has a system that are basically killzone if you are in them for to long. Each side has different squads you can play as with four people per squad. Each squad has different roles and different weapons. Then, each role has three levels or upgrades they can have.   I highly recommend this game if you want more than a run and gun shooter where accuracy is key.",1,0

417860,Emily is Away,"This, my friends, is what a text based storyline should be. Let's browse through and nitpick.  POSITIVE: - The game storyline is great! The choices feel meaningful. - The characters are developed and entertaining too. - There's a bunch of hidden easter eggs if you make your screen name 'password123', they're really cool!  NEGATIVE: - There's not much play time :( Sad, because it's a great game. - A lot of the choices actually don't matter, like decisions whether to go to parties/take alchohol etc. Really puts down the game a bit. - I wish you could talk to more than one person. But that's just a tip for the future.  OVERALL: This game is really amazing, and i definitely recommend it. (Also using screen name 'password123' to unlock the icons is really cool and has HL3 references :D) The positives far outweigh the negatives. It is an in-depth text based story, and is really at a zenith of quality for indie games.",1,0

337000,Deus Ex: Mankind Divided™,"I have played every Dues ex since the first. This one was okay... basically okay.  If you want to just do the story line, you would easily complete this within 10 hours. That is also based on a run without any advantages and all side quests that I came upon (Total time 36hours).  Now i am not claiming too have done all the achivements, but the meat and bones of the story i have done (This all done on Give me Dues Ex difficulty). So lets get down to brass tax.  Positive: + Visually it looks brilliant, and even on my old rig, of 7 + years old, it still ran at 50-60fps on high settings with MSAA off. It still looked stunning. + UI customization for a PC port was excelent, as were the graphical options. + Loads of kick ♥♥♥ augments, as you would expect. + Choice within in game was good.  Neutral: = Progresses the story okay wise, with a decent cliff hanger (prepare for Deus Ex: Civil war or the like). = level design is okay, as somtimes u can be very confused with the objections on a map with 8 floors, when sometimes you are on floor 5 and it totally ignores the floors 6/7 on the UI. = Being given the ability to do all the skills without consequence is a nice idea, however i really think it should have been kept for the second play through. Basically as you wont max out the skill system, unless you pay for it (Or really really grind you ♥♥♥ off).  Negitives: - Way too short, first run through only took 36 hours, and that included a tone of deaths, and a barrel load of exploration (this also included about 1 hour at the begining to get the fps stable). - I left this till now, cause its a touchy subject. Micro transactions, mainly cause the game is so very short, and really if you pay more than the game price you are a idiot. - It wont take the save from you previous Deus ex: revolution. - This will split the community, but i honestly belive if it had remained a PC excusive it would have been miles better, and with more content. Also without the need to put in the micro transactions. Personally I think if that is put into a game, and it effects the basic principle of the game like it does here, then you are not very confedent in the game you have produced. - The breach mini game, is really not needed, its basically the same game, with a differnt skin. Its very lazy, and would rather see the effort put into the games main story line.  Overall I would recomend this game for deus EX fans like myself, however as a individual game as its own right, I cant give this anymore than a 5/10. Its just to short, and not enough challange on the highest difficulty setting.",-1,0

311340,METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES,"Port Quality   Absolutely worth the money on PC, especially if you can grab it on sale. Graphics quality scales nicely, and every visual enhancement works in the game's favor. Only technical downside is the game isnt fully optimized for keyboard and mouse, though you either get used to it, or use a controller. For the first MGS game on PC in a while, Kojima Productions has done a phenomenal job.  Gameplay  One of the best open world games on PC simply because the stealth mechanics work so well. Of course, the entire game itself takes place in one, fairly open air level. What that means is a lot of tagging guards and taking them out. This is essentially the grind of the game, but the AI is robust and varied, so there are many approaches to even just disabling an enemy and it never gets boring. This is good, as there are only 7 missions, most of which dont take longer than an hour (if you're bad) to complete. These missions have varied objectives, from assassinating targets to extracting prisoners, and the only way to get the highest ranks is to be stealthy. If stealthing isnt your thing, there is still a lot of fun to be had in using deadlier methods, and those techniques have their own variations as well. The fact is that there is a lot of hours of gameplay, but you have to be willing to explore these styles of play, and really have to want to play missions again and again to get the highest ranks, not necessarily 100% the game (like me) but to try missions a different way each time.  Story  Not as cerebral or involved, plot wise, but still has good character development and twists. A downside to this is that most of the story is told through casette tapes, so you have to be really interested in the MGS backstory to listen to the tapes from this game, and from MGS Peacewalker, which are included. Because of this there are no classic MGS codec conversations, which is a bummer. Another let down is that Snake hardly talks at all in this game, everything is told at him and he hardly has repsonses for what is going on, other than a constant scowl on his face. Which is appropriate considering the completely horrifying situation his comrades are facing at the hands of the new villain. MGS is taking a more serious tone here, and its not only in the name of making light of terrible situations that happen in warfare, but it also gives the characters and story depth that is really engaging on another level.   I do think some of it will go too far for some people, especially those who look to MGS to be their slapstick, goofy military tropes game, as a breather from all these super-hardcore modern military shooters (whose stories are only for the most intellectual and serious of adults, amirite?). For those people, this story will rub them the wrong way, but if they never treated the MGS story as serious in the first place, they don't really deserve to be angry or bewildered that the story they never cared about is trying to make a story in a videogame be taken seriously.  Overall, I immensely enjoyed this game, would recommend for anybody at its sale price, and for stealth and MGS fans at any price.",1,1

At least that's what I did. The only problem is as you get higher in level the need for expansion packs becomes apparent. Now that I think about it LOTRO is almost like The Elder Scrolls Online.

9900,Star Trek Online,"While many people critiques this game for being buggy and the constant need to pay to progress well I find it quite a good MMO for a massive Star Trek fan.  The game itself does have some bugs or mission breaking problems but you can restart all missions and generally it works the 2nd time, also regarding pay to progress yes when you reach Max level you need to pay $$$ to get a good ship and gear or if you have time you can earn Dilithiam (one of the ingame currencies) that you can sell for Zen (The real money currency)  I have played well over 400 hours so far (And 100 since I moved to playing this on steam) and I have spent about $40 of real money on it, that money was used to but extra character slots to create a few Alts to do Missions to get extra Dilithium.  Pro's:  * Very Good story missions * The new Delta recruit system rewards you for making new characters * Voices from various Star Trek actors * Totally free to play if you have the patience * Pick up and play if you have an hour to kill you can hop in have a go at a few events and log off * Great graphics for an older game that will run on most systems * Event - New events are added all the time * Constant update: New missions are added all the time * Loads of classic Star Trek areas to explore  Cons: * OK Bugs some missions are bugged which you can bypass  * Bridge Officers (Power) have a tenancy to reset if you switch ships which means you need to reset them * A few features that seems to be there but abandoned (Gold pressed latinum store) would be nice to have expanded or at least updated * Queues for some PVP and PVE events can take to long due to lack of people not max level participating (XP rewards boost needed)  So all in all it is worth getting and giving this game a go if you like star trek at all",1,0

I have never obtained the amulet, but have gotten to level 20 once or twice. It is one of the most complex, infuriating and beautiful games ever created.  Vulture adds a mediocre 2.5d tileset and a fairly unintuitive GUI. Without my previous knowledge of the standard Nethack commands, I wouldn't be able to figure out how to do certain things without the manual (which cannot be open at the same time as the game). Thankfully the numpad maps to the actual directions of the tunnels, which are isometric.   Vulture is a little awkward, forcing me to switch from numpad to keyboard to mouse all the time (you cannot play with just the mouse like I had hoped, since right click works for just about everything but choosing from your inventory, and mouse control works badly for movement)  Someday someone will make a program to make NetHack accessable, but it is not this day.

227220,Sang-Froid - Tales of Werewolves,"Enjoyable gameplay with good atmosphere. I enjoyed the trap laying and excecution aspects of the game. I do not recommend this game, though. The reason being that it contains some of the worst writing and the very worst voice acting I have ever witnessed anywhere. Storyline could be passable were it not for the instantly despisable characters and their pathetic attempts at emotion. Perhaps if you can ignore such aspects, you might enoy this game but if the story and its pieces mean anything to you, avoid it.",-1,0
332800,Five Nights at Freddy's 2,"Five Nights At Freddy's 2. To be completely honest, this game is MUCH scarier than the first. When you saw the first game for the first time there was this feeling of not knowing anything about the game, and not knowing what to do or how to do it. And then you got used to the first game so that it wasn't as scary or hard anymore. But then this one comes out. And it brings that feeling back. But this time on another level. You notice the feeling, and you're really confused because it should be just like the first game and because you are so experienced with the first game, but Scott actually changed/added a lot more things to this game. There is now 10 animatronics that you have to worry about (11 if you include Golden Freddy) which makes the game a LOT more stressfull. The sound for the jumpscares is MUCH more startling than the sound in the first one. All together, this game is a lot scarier and more stressfull than the first, and I would highly recommend it to people who like getting jumped. 9.5/10",1,0

372000,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),"Largest concern by far is the need of a function to begin banning those accounts that get blocked by at 1% of the server. So far the cash for in game money has been bad no the worst but bad. Ive seen the price drops with other friends of mine and there not making much if the drop in price over a few minutes is any telling since its dropped by far in the past 2 days. That being said the AWESOME ogre tactics and FF tactics feel of the artwork and secret of mana gameplay style has yet to leave me bored, as long as im on a quest anyhow. The game still has a ton of classes i havent experienced and teh system in place feels like a good direction as far as class structure and skill learning. Being a game that will be free to play they do have in game currency of there own and a store. !!! But all are cosmetic!!! a fantastic trend in f2p games. The writing at this time is about par for most rpgs and mmos if that improves with time and regional references this game still will only get better. !!!!! NOW ON TO THE 2ND BIGGEST PROBLEM!!! LAG... My box is above standard game rigs. My internet speeds are 220 (out of the 250 they say) Down and 17(out of the 20 they say) up. It appears they didnt iether expect gold sellers or stolen account data, nor the exccessive positive influx of people. SO the servers have been gettig wasted...

208580,STAR WARS™ Knights of the Old Republic™ II: The Sith Lords™,"+ Great Star Wars story. + Native widescreen support (that's good for such an old game). + Lots of mods thorugh Steam's Workshop (mostly textures, which is good). + Native Xbox 360 controller support (both kb+m and gamepad are pretty good). + Nice gameplay (it reminds me a bit of Dragon Age Origins). + Nice music and fx. + Lots of choices which assure at least 2 replays.  - Dated graphics (but quite good for its age). - Quite restrictive areas (similar to The Withcer 2). - Minor bugs (small things like AI getting stucked in corners).  If you like Star Wars and like RPGs (and don't care about dated graphics), this is highly recommended.",1,0
230410,Warframe,"This is a great game. I like all the different Tenno (Characters) you can choose from. The personalization isnt bad either. The trading system allows you to make the platnum you would otherwise have to buy. If i could change something, it would be all the updates and new content being added regularly. It's jjust too much, really. The new content is really nice, but i want to play it, not download it. Actually, i would also change the bag system. We, as dedicated players and supporters of Warframe, should be able to purchase extra bag slots with platinum. And at at a reasonable price as well.

91700,E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy,"E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy has been coded by crazy people and is in its own way ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic once you accept that you just are not going to understand what's going on and that you have a katana that blocks bullets somehow and that it's almost as if a really wasted DM made a Shadowrun campaign then someone coded it while taking 15 minute breaks to stretch their legs and bang grams of coke.  E.Y.E is a linear RPG with a collection of nice ideas but flawed executions. You can play alone or cooperatively with up to three other friends, taking on quests for the Culter clan. The gameplay is a mix of Deus Ex and Fallout 3, where you can take on some quests in multiple ways - alternate entrances, barging in through the front door, hacking certain access points to finish your objective. It's nice in co-op when one character can focus on building a particular skill (hacking was mine, for example) and another can spend points on other attributes to better round out the team.  The biggest problem this game has is its low-budget trappings and short campaign length. While I was surprised how good the gunplay felt, don't expect voice acting, quality translation, a fleshed out story and characters etc. It's a few notches above a bare-bones mod running on Source. E.Y.E is also rather brief, about 10 hours or so with nothing to keep you playing afterward.  This game is essentially Deus Ex but ten times f**king weirder and I love it for that, within the first 20 minutes you kill your mentor but you are not his murderer, fight a creature of the Metastreumonic-force, shoot a bandit with a shotgun from a mile away, and talk to people who may or may not even exist.  If the story is too confusing for you, I'll provide a rundown: You are part of an organization whose primary goal is to rescue space turtles. You travel the galaxy rescuing space turtles. That is all you need to know.",1,0

391040,F1 2016,"They are getting better with this version for sure. I like a lot about it but find that it fails to deliver the smoothness I look for in the graphics, particularly with the anti aliasing effects making everything look a bit jagged in the distance, and for me personally, this is a deal breaker and find that sims such as iRacing have much better AA effects in place. Graphics are not everything of course, and I find the graphics in F1 very decent, although found no way to improve the AA to a satisfactory level even on ultra settings.   I wanted to love this game though as they nailed it with all official teams and tracks, which is very cool. No on else out there has the lisence to F1 but codemasters. The career mode seams to be very indepth and well made as well as unique, although the character animations are very cartoon like which puts a damper on giving the game a simulation feel, but the wide array of options settings for the cars and view and such are nice and give a simulation depth. The force feedback seems much better than past versions as do the physics, so well done there.  Better AA and better frame rate optimization may have kept this game in my library rather than ending up as a refund. SO close, yet so far away. If the lack of smooth edges in the distance and overall doesn't bother you, or if your system does a better job than mine smoothing them out somehow, this may be right up your alley if you're really into F1. But for me, close but no cigar quite yet.  Perhaps next season they'll perfect it and I'll be back with a stellar review...until then....

230410,Warframe,"Warframe is a perfect example of what a free to play game can be. This game could easily flourish as a retail game, but its current model is extremely well done, and provides a level of depth most triple A titles cannot. While the levels can become repetative, the way the levels are layed out provides a good change of pace. The constant updating, hotfixes, and improvements show the developers care, and this seems like a free to play game with the kind of longevity other games can only dream of. The gameplay is innovative, not in that it adds crazy new weapon mechanics or things like that, but the amount of depth and control you can have in fire fights, or stealth if you choose, is unlike any game, F2P or not, before it. I'd recommend Warframe to anyone looking for something different from the CoDs and Counter Strikes. Or even to someone looking for a great Co-op experience. Warframe has it all, and if you are willing to put time into it and understand the game mechanics, it can be one of the deepest and most rewarding gaming experiences out there.",1,0

Great, uplifting music, superb story, great gameplay elements, and it has a beautiful graphics. Don't be stuck up on the graphics being edgy, bricky. The games was originally made in 1999. And it has a voxel engine, meaning it isn't drawing triangles on the screen, but instead small cubes. This makes the game's mountains, snow, crystals and rocks and water simply beautiful.

Just remember: 'The journey is more important than the destination.' - Arthur Ashe         Spoilers:  I don't mean to go too pretentious here, but a 'government conspiracy' would NEVER do that game ANY justice. The ending is more like an english professor, hard to understand, but very knowledgable and understandable. This isn't a man with 'guns blazing action.' He is a regular joe that escapes reality, takes this job in order to fully escape the sad, sad, life he was living. The ending of never seeing Delilah and an awkward goodbye drive home the towers of absolute guilt, tragedy, and mostly escapism (especially how it never lasts, you eventually have to come back to reality, like a videogame). One more thing, I wish the ending included them meeting up and falling in love, but the ending we have chalks my previous points up. The name itself is 'Firewatch.' They don't go around fixing and stopping fires, they just sit back and watch it happen. They never could fall in love and fix each other's problems, as they were just meant to cross paths.",1,0

It is fast paced and it got my heart racing. had to make sure and stop playing right before before bed because it made me wide awake. The weapon upgrades, suit upgrades, and weapon mods really made the game a little more RPG-ish. I also really enjoyed the story. SPOILER - it ends on a cliff hanger.   The graphics and music are awesome. I just got a new GeForce GTX 1080 and in all the action and on Ultra, the frames never dropped below 60 FPS.

I see the lives, for which I lay down my life - peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy..... I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence..... It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to, than I have ever known......

221040,Resident Evil 6,"The Bad:  Like being fustrated to the point of rage? Buy this game. It's controls are some of the worst I've ever seen. Enemies designed to drive you to the point of actual violence with QTE attacks that can interupt anything you do. Awful partner AI that hinders progress to the point it will actually kill you (Cathedral cluster♥♥♥♥ with the Church doors and the endlessly respawning enemies comes to mind) A pointless inventory system that can also kill you as you struggle to put healing items into a 'Case' as if inventory management meant anything anymore, hell you can't even pause the game during a session, this is not Dark Souls, because if it was it would actually be rewarding.   Backgrounds are dull and cliched with no dept to them whatsoever, your dragged from one set piece to another and expected to be wowed by the Hollywood action vibe of it as your bombarded with yet more QTE's. It runs well enough but my god are some of the textures awful low res, they would look lacklustre in RE4, this creates a weird contrast between the generally good character models and the background, a side effect of a badly designed port.  It's as if they got all the worst traits of the last 2 'over the shoulder' action Resident Evil games and jacked them up to 11, no lessons learned at all, but hey ♥♥♥♥ it right? It makes the money. And I spent as little as I could to buy this, so I had an idea of what I was getting into. If I could compare it to anything, I'd say this is Resident Evil's FEAR 3. Total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.   The Good:  It's Resident Evil (Just about). You can suplex and bodyslam Zombies, which is as ridiculous as it is fun. Chris is essentially John Cena at this point anyway.

206440,To the Moon,"Firstly I absolutely recommend this game. It's short but it's only a few pounds and worth every penny.  I guess in many ways this is more of an interactive story than a game. There is some traditional gameplay, but you play through the little puzzle sections, motivated by the need to open up the brilliantly put together story. And you do go through a journey in this. Yes, it's quite short but I haven't played many games that have moved me in the way this one did. I played through with my 6 year old son who really enjoyed it to.   There are some games I think are more than games - they're experiences, and this is one. I would recommend it just to experience the story.",1,0

It’s like some really bad Chuck Norris film from the 90’s, point your gun in a direction, and the bad guys line up for you. Just pull the trigger. It’s like Flappy Bird with guns. Eff consoles and what they’ve done to ruin FPS’s. Eff Cod. Oh I forgot, there’s a mission where you can control a dog tank. Or, by some amazing trick of mind control zoom into any soldier and control them. It’s lost the effing plot, the story is utter ♥♥♥♥♥, the characters are effing empty and ♥♥♥♥♥, I skipped all the cinematics after the first few, you simply don’t care about these 8 bit effers. Eff consoles again. Treyarch must be effing laughing at us stupid effers for buying that ♥♥♥♥, regurgitating maps, skins, guns, graphics, sounds. Getting some growly voiced actor to blandly speak some pointless words, spend a week making it look like the characters in game are speaking them, don’t worry about facial expressions or body language, they don’t have to match. Add something to make it different from the last ♥♥♥♥♥ we put out – “I got it – sunglasses!”. Effing unbelievable. I didn't even try the MP, that might be mildly enjoyable to pass the time, but I doubt it.",-1,0

256290,Child of Light,"Let's nominate this for the “I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye” Award! --- So you're not looking for just a game? You want an experience, you want to be sucked right into the world you're playing in? Well, that's what this game did to me.  The saying 'the whole is more than the sum of it's parts' was never more applicable than with this game. And it's exactly that, what makes this game such an awesome experience. The beautiful unique graphic style, the interesting rhyming theme and above all the stunning music by Coeur de Pirate, made it all come together in this rough but shiny gem of a game.  Let me be honest... It's not perfect. The gameplay mechanics are solid, but not revolutionary. The battlesystem is comparable to the Active Time Battle system from Final Fantasy, with a few interesting tweaks to it. The story is also decent: it has it's interesting moments, but can also be quite predictable at times.  But it's where all the elements are combined, what sets this game apart from it's kind. All the characters have their unique stories and personalities to them, which made me feel for and with them. Most of the time I was just too involved with what was going on to even notice the little flaws in the story. I never found myself craving for a more complex or interactive battlesystem, as the battletheme and graphics made every battle into an something epic. Besides, using each character's strenghts and weaknesses to their best can make the battles a lot more interesting, if you're willing to familiarise yourself with them. At times, I found myself not wanting to progress to new areas, because I didn't want to stop listening to the music and instead just explore every interesting corner of the beautiful landscapes.  No, it's not the perfect game. But all the elements just seem to come together so naturally, that for me it left nothing more to be desired from. I often still listen to the OST when lying in bed, reliving the experience and falling to sleep peacefully and satisfied.  Simply put: this game makes me happy...",1,0

391220,Rise of the Tomb Raider,"This was a nice step up from 'Tomb Raider,' the first game in the reboot series, which I wasn't terribly impressed with after beating.  Just about everything was much more impressive, and I definitely believe that had a lot to do with complaints about the shortcomings of the first.  The combat is much more fun in terms of the number of weapons and ammo you can choose from. It's very fluid even when stealth killing which is nice. Dodging and countering are more apparent which makes melee battles more interesting.  The crafting mechanic is pretty expansive, from on the run Molotovs and smoke grenades, to exploding shotgun rounds and hollowpoint pistol rounds.  I enjoyed a few of the puzzles, though I believe some of the original series provided a greater challenge.   All in all, definitely worth a couple playthroughs.",1,1

In the four year span, you will converse with your high school friend, Emily, and experience the changes that take place on each individual traversing the crucial molding period of any young adult's life.

304050,Trove,"April 20 2016, Mantle of Power expansion   As of this week the mantle of power expansion has launched, totally sinking this game into a deep P2W and P2enjoy pit.   The grind became even harder, many useful builds have been nerfed and the new worlds are just old biomes made larger with the same dungeons as you find them in the prime world.   There are gems now that are essential to your combat power. Those have to be upgraded via gem dust and can break on a failed upgrade. You could ofc pay your ♥♥♥ off in real money to make upgrading easier. Gem rolls are completely random to a point where a lower rarity gem can be better than a high rarity one.   Level cap got raised to 30, you got to complete about 10000 dungeons to get from 20 to 21 in U6. Thanks, Trion.  They are implementing more features that try to make you pay real money every update, there is no love to the community but only the will to get every cent out of their players. People who pay still have to grind the hell out of the game. There are an incredible lot of shop-only exclusives.  Endgame still does not exist, only the way there is much longer and has more obstacles now. And it's a repetitive way. other than mining ( searching resources, throwing bombs on resource node, repeat) and doing dungeons (find dungeon, rush in and kill boss, repeat) there is no way at all to progress.  If you are not putting real money into this game you will quickly get the feeling you are missing something, this should not happen. looking at how much worse this game just got I can't even give a good review with all of my good will.   Stay away from it. Go play Warframe or something instead.",-1,0
203770,Crusader Kings II,"On my 500th hour of Crusader Kings, I decided to write a review and reflect back on all this time I've spent on the game.   To start, Crusader Kings II is an excellent game, it's one of those games you can forget about for a couple weeks and then come back to when you realize it's there or are looking for a different speed and type of game that day (or night). To be honest, I don't have the conclave pack because of what all the reviews said, however, I have everything else and I've immensely enjoyed the game with all of the content the developers continually add to the game. I really like that one day I can play as an Indian Raja and conquer the Middle East after conquering the Sub-Continent and then the next day I can play as an Anglo-Saxon Muslim, re-enacting John, King of England's plea (and offer of conversion to Islam) in exchange for help against those dastardly French.   I will say that after 500 hours you would expect me to have more achievements but I really don't use ironman mode that often, usually I forget to turn it on but also because sometimes I enjoy stacking the deck in my favor and really screwing with history (who doesn't enjoy a Pruthenian Cathar Kingdom every once in awhile?).   If you're looking for a good game to soak up some time, use some brain cells while plotting how you'll steal the crown from your second cousin or play a strategy game with some friends, this is for sure the game for you. I can't recommend this game enough to everyone from casual gamers to hardcore gamers, it really has something for everyone and as you can tell from the time I've spent playing it, you can certainly sink time into the game.",1,0

While other games claim to be next-gen with impressive graphics and physics, Assassin's Creed merges technology, game design, theme and emotions into a world where you instigate chaos and become a vulnerable, yet powerful, agent of change.

20900,The Witcher: Enhanced Edition,"Quick Review: If you want an immersive game that can last you hours on end, get this game right now. If you simply want to blow through this game simply because you want to see the begining, read on.  Long story short the game is good but has VERY annoying features that would frustrate those who are trying to speed through using melee. The game often throws 10-15 enemies at once later in the game and many enemies can stun for 6 seconds and can chain it. Also dodging is not very useful and counterplay against hard bosses is almost non-existant.   However, investing many skill points in to Signs(spells) can make the game easier, though almost too easy.  In conclusion if you want a long lasting experience full of content and interesting characters and story, buy the game at its current price. If you want to just go through the game as fast as possible, get it on sale. (On sale you can get both Witcher 1 and 2 for $5)",1,0

403190,Planetbase,"Atmosphere, looks, experience are on point, however, some small features could've been better - for example there's no option to create a separate base or structure, once the first oygen generator built, no options to upgrade buildings if the base's needs grew out of them, or at least a decent system to make possible to place a building on the ground where currently raw materials are waiting to be stored (can't even give out the building order til these materials aren't moved, which takes a loooong time). Another thing: the AI of the colonists could be better. MUCH better. Recycling a building also can be a pain in the back on some ways, that needs balancing too. However, i've spent more than 100 hours with the game so far, and planning to play more, since the experience altogether is something really uniqe, i really like the fact that it needs attention to expand, and maintain things... One mistake, and there's no coming back, which is enjoyable at the beginning but when u have a base so big u can't even remember, where is what, this could've been balanced way better. With some small improvements, this game can be epic. Still love it though :)",1,0

He tells us about the epidemic and how he managed to find shelter. His voice sounds stoic. It seems like he's been out there for quite some time.  'You, grab the sniper rifle, head to the balcony, and clear the way to the entrance of the cinema', Luke tells my friend. Then he looks at me, 'And us, we're going to break through. Come on!'  As we fight ourselves through the horde of the undead outside, something must have gone wrong.   'They got me! They got me!', I hear Luke screaming.  Those screams. I could not forget them. They still haunt me. And they alway will. Luke was down. The dead were feeding upon his body.  'You have to kill me. I don't wanna turn!' 'Luke! Don't die on us!', I hear my friend shouting in despair. 'It's too late', his fading voice whispers.   Some last coughs. Then a gurgling sound.

However, I do take issue with the fact it is advertised as a roguelike, when it isn't in any real meaningful way.   If there was a 'possibly recommend' option, I'd pick that. I am going with 'recommend' for now as it seems like the devs at least had fun with the game and tried making it humorous (again, not my style, but the effort is at least there).",1,0

263560,Paper Sorcerer,"I got to about 1/3 of the way through Paper Sorcerer playing on hard, and I won't be finishing it. The regular battles have become a rather repetitive rotation of building up energy for abilities, tank taunting, healing, and damage. I don't vary my strategies much because there's not much of a need. After the first floor of the dungeon, you can full heal any living party members at any time by going back to town. It sort of takes away the need to optimize. You see, the resource management for multiple battles just isn't there in this game. There's not really much interesting individual character customization. Despite these flaws, I'm still going to recommend Paper Sorcerer.  Why?  The visuals are unique and a cool blend of retro/modern style. The music is fantastic. The classes are interesting and there are a bunch of viable party compositions. It's $5 for 10 hours of solid, if not spectactular dungeon crawling. For someone who has played a lot of strategy games and RPGs, hard difficulty felt perfect. I never felt the need to grind, but bosses always felt like the perfect challenge. Ohh...the bosses in this game. They are tough and definitely reward strategy. If I could play just the boss fights then yeah, I would've finished the game. Not only are they diverse encounters, but they challenge you to radically change your tactics.  So, Paper Sorcerer has got plenty enough positivies going for it that despite my being done with it early, it's a thumbs up from. Anyone intersted for a first person dungeon crawler will get at least multiple hours of enjoyment out of it.",1,0

204100,Max Payne 3,"Max Payne is pretty good. 10/10 IGN  The thing with Max Payne 3 is, that it lacks that film noir style, dark, rainy, snowy, setting (with 1 flashback exception). I understand that rockstar felt they have to change things up. But they already did with this very tense story, the short bursts of all out action, split by cinematic sequences. This being said, I miss the nostalgic feel of Max Pane 2: The Fall of Max Payne. I mean MP 3 (haha what a stupid abbreviation) has some references to the likes of Mona Sax and Baseballbat-Boy, but I think there was a lot more potential. I understand the formerly noted change of gameplay, but I think Rockstar should've taken more risks by furthermore add to the franchise. And I'm by no means demanding a new love affair or such thing, since that would dilute the storyline and nostalgia of the prequels, something successors should never do, but I would've appreciated more deviant characters, that are crazy and unusual. Maybe even a new brazilian style mascot with maybe a short passage of similar gameplay as the 'escort mission' of BB-Boy in MP 2. Given that is a fairly absurd example, but that character is in the series since the first game and I think a llitte more than just one or 2 references would've sufficed. Yet it is very enjoyable, but doesn't run very well on my newish mac. It's not the hardware but the engine an port to Mac. In a few instances in very specific parts of levels, there was a sudden avalanche of graphical glitches like particle effects appearing completeley black, and the shading messing up, resulting in triangles and circles showing as black outlines in the level. But again other level where running perfectly fine.  Anyway for people who grew up with the Max Payne series, it is going to lack some Fan Service, but again will astonish you with brutally, brutally realistic sequences of a crook getting bursted by Max, which in it self is shockingly good and rewarding. Especially after you tried the same section around 10 times (on hard) and finally get that last enemy and finally clear the section.   So yes its worth it. I personally would love a Max Payne 2 remake with this new engine though (and a better port for Mac but thats secondary), and believe it would be the better Max Payne 3.",1,0

I decided to buy this during the winter sale when it was 66% off, thinking it was a good deal. In reality they butcherd the game. Graphic wise they are the same, but it use a HUGE amount of memory this time which causes crashes for low end computers. The game play is horrible. Unit icons are small and too similar to be able to be quick decissive desisions. They took out the cammand tree. Sniper are absolutely usless now. They can only be in camo when they are in cover and present no significant role on a battle feild. They story of campaign mode has alot of people calling Relic Nazi lovers due the depiction of Russain soldiers being dogs and the officers killing them left and right.

243470,Watch_Dogs,"This game right here? This is why I hate console ports. Release date says 27 May 2014, but it feels like the game is still in beta (27 June 2014). Instead of wasting your time writing out something that has been said over and over here are the top 5 reasons not to get this game (even with 20% off it's not worth it):  1) uPlay 2) Stuttering problems (1 month post release and counting) so bad it becomes unplayable 3) Console level graphics. 4) Driving forces you to use a gamepad if you want any sort of control. 5) uPlay. Yes uPlay sucks so badly that it gets featured twice.  So unless you really hit your head hard, this is not for you. That or download theWorse's mod, a lone guy trying to fix something Ubisoft won't bother with.  Update: 2 months on, 2 updates out, still not playable. If there was one thing I really regret in life, it is putting my trust in Ubisoft. I feel like I'm being robbed and that they don't really care, because they already have my money in hand. SHOULD this game ever get fixed, it would be way to late for me to enjoy the online aspect of this game. I'd recommend this game in about 2 years, if you can get it in a bargain bin or free, because spending money on it is like taking money and spending it on a ticket on malasian airways. Trust me, you'll regret it.",-1,0
368230,Kingdom: Classic,"So, after over 40 hours spent playing the game I felt it's time to finally write a review.  First of all, I really enjoy this game tremendously, but I'd say it's not for everyone. If you read other reviews, you probably have a good idea what the good part of the game is, nice art, awesome soundtrack (first time I ever bought a game OST, and not regretting it one bit). These are the two things I think everyone can agree about.  Then it gets more tricky. The gameplay isn't for everyone. It's literally discover everything for yourself. including how your own guys behave, even how your own horse behaves. The real problem can come from when you don't figure some things out (like how to keep your horse running or how to make your dudes not suicide themselves constantly) and then give up thinking the devs didn't think of that and write review claiming the game is unfinished or lacking.  On the other hand, simply reading a guide after 5 hours of play, is basically ruining the discovery experience, so in my opinion if you want to enjoy the game try to not look up too many things (or maybe just ask a simple singe question in the forums instead).  Now, that being said, another big deterrent can be the lack of endgame content. (It needs to be said though, that the devs are working on adding more stuff (for free), so that might not be true anyore in a few months.) For me, it took me over 10 hours to beat the game the first time I think, and after that, there where achievements for doing it quick and for enduring long. The speedrunning aspect I really liked, but the endurance aspect (trying to survive as long as you can) is really lacking atm. Once you're set up there's not much to do for 30-50 days, cause you're defenses are just that good. So if you really enjoy building up a large empire and surviving a long time, this game is in it's current stage definitely not for you (imo). Me personally, I really enjoy the speedrunning aspect of the game, so trying over and over to finish the game quicker and quicker is really fun for me and is mostly what kept me going for the last 25 hours or so. (Especially since people keep getting quicker and quicker :D) It also means that one has to learn more and more details about the game mechanics, which I really like too. I've played over 40 hours and still learn new stuff.  But even without doing speedruns, I think the game offers enough content to be worth the money, unless you basically spoiler yourself with guides before you even start (at which point it's getting a bit boring and mechanical, as the normal playthrough isn't that dificult once you understand most mechanics). A big fun aspect of the game is losing horribly a lot and then learning more and more how stuff works and then at some point you just easily beat it using all your hard gained knowledge and it feels really good. But if you just look up everything, that sense of achievement will never happen and the game will probably feel a bit bland.  Two last negative points I want to mention, one is a bug the other a framerate problem. There is still a bug that can break the game a little. Like it can happen that you win, but you don't get the victory and all your dudes stop working. If you don't know that this is a bug it can get quite frustrating. The first time I actually beat the game this happened and I didn't realize it was not supposed to happen, so I spent another 20 days trying to figure out how to win until someone in the forums exaplined to me that this is a bug. (If that happens to you, just exit and start again, and it should put you before the bug happens and you should be fine from there on). The framerate issues 'luckily' only happen later on (say day 60 and upwards and usually only during blood moon nights where a lot of monsters appear), so if there wasn't an achievement for surviving 100 days most people would probably never experience it. But there is. And they do. Regardless of how good your computer rig is it seems.  I want to end with saying I had a quite magical time with this game. I bought it right when it came out and a lot of people were streaming it at that point. Since there weren't any guides available at this time it created a very unqie atmosphere, where I would hop from stream to stream watching a bit, seeing what others might have figured out that I haven't, sharing some small tips here and there myself. It really reminded me of the earlier days of gaming, when you couldn't just look up everything online but went to friends places shared and small discoveries with each others. That's something I haven't experienced in over a decade and I probably won't in quite a while. So I just want to end by shouting a big 'thank you' to the devs for creating this marvelous experience with their game and I stay curious to see where they take it from here.  TL;DR : If you enjoy being a scientist, testing stuff, doing things to see what happens, learn from that, be willing to accept to fail a few times until you get it right, enjoy atmospheric pixel art and great soundtrack the this game might really be for you. If you want to expand and grow an empire and survive a long time, don't enjoy to figure stuff and gameplay mechanics out for yourself, then you might give this game a pass (at least for now). There is more content coming, so maybe come back in 6 months and see how the game has developed by reading the latest news and content updates and see what people have to say then.  Anyway, hope this review helped give a good voerview about the good and bad aspects of the game. Please thumbs up if you find it helpful as well, so others can benefit from the reivew too :)",1,1

Personally, I think this game is already worth checking out at least once just for its art direction. It starts out with beautiful, calm and bright landscapes - which are really colorful and highly detailed; once ♥♥♥♥ starts hitting the fan, that beautiful Wonderland turns into something ghastly, corrupted and quite disturbing - the catch is, it's equally appealing. As stated, eye-candy is abundant from start to finish and you will have many opportunities to catch your breath and take some beautiful screenshots.  Platforming is a big part of 'Alice Madness Returns' and it seems it gets worse as the game goes on. The problem is that one can only pull so many levers before getting bored. The level design plays a vital role here; it is extremely linear and you are pretty much getting from point A to point B with little to no side objectives - collectibles alleviate this by making you go off your main path; unfortunately, by the end of the game, you will most likely find yourself ignoring some (if not most) of them, since they required YET another lever and a couple more jumps and floats.  Story-wise, this game shines. The story is nothing to write home about but it does a decent enough job of making you wanting to keep playing - I guess it ends quite abruptly but still, it's good in my opinion. It manages to keep you invested in Alice's 'quest' and the use of 'Alice in Wonderland''s characters was refreshing (even though the first game did it better).  Voice acting is, as said, really good. You meet your fair share of looney characters with high pitched voices and your dark enemies have intimidating voices and sound effects. The soundtrack is great. I think it is the kind of soundtrack I would buy if it was available. Weapon sounds also feels great as you cut enemies in halt and fill their ♥♥♥♥'s with (peppered) lead.  Combat stays fresh for most of the game. Enemies require different strategies to be defeated and later on there are multiple types of enemies at the same time which requires you to adapt accordingly to the enemies weaknesses. You have 4 weapons (or 5 if you count the umbrella) at your disposal and, even though I wanted more weapons, including some from the original game, they are enough to keep the combat engaging. Being able to upgrade them with Teeth (in-game currency) is also a bonus since you can turn your fluffy looking Hobby Horse into a full-fledged fire breathing stallion of punishment and death or your traditional Pepper Grinder into a.... full-fledged fire breathing... cooking..... tool.... ..... of punishment and death. However, the camera tends to flip out during combat and changing targets is a shore, usually costing you a chunk of your health.  Invisible walls are everywhere, some small holes and gaps where Alice could easily fit in are regarded as impossible to cross and, considering the game is 'quite' recent, it is something I found both annoying and disappointing. They are everywhere.  I made a mistake while playing this game. I thought 'I am going to play this for 2 or 3 hours' and let me tell you that it is something I sincerely do not recommend you to do. Most levels go like this: Jump, jump, jump and float; pull a lever/switch; more platforms show up; you can jump some more just to pull yet another lever; once you reach a bigger platform, you will have a battle; once you finish off all the enemies, more platforms show up. You then put a Bomb on a pressure pad so the platforms don't disappear and make your way to the other side well before the bomb detonates; then you will jump some more and pull some more levers... Sounds repetitive? That's because it is! I believe, after the first 2 hours or, let's say, 2/3 levels, this game gets on your nerves fairly quickly. I recommend it in short bursts.  But still, this may sound bad and all but Alice moves so effortlessly that the platforming sections feel graceful. It feels great even though it eventually gets boring.  Some other bugs break the experience a little bit. One example is when you jump on a mushroom (it acts like a trampoline), you can only move again once Alice reaches the top of her ascension and starts falling down again; if you were pressing forward when you were going up, you will need to press it again after Alice starts descending so she moves forward - have fun dying because of it, since you will find yourself wasting extra jumps in the air while standing still.  For me, 'Alice Madness Returns' is a big disappointment, yet, I can't bring myself to hate it.  Here's the thing: I wanted to like this game. Unfortunately, I found myself getting frustrated and bored for a big chunk of its 14 or so hours of story.  Is it worth buying? Not for 10 €. I would suggest 75% off, considering the game's age. But still, if you like engaging stories and value art design in video games, 5 € should be ok as well. It is a game everyone should experience at least once!  As far as replay value goes... I think you will only be playing this once.  This game had so much potential. It could have been something as epic as 'Batman: Arkham City'. That's what makes me sad.  Score: 6.5 out of 10.",1,1

225080,Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons,"I really enjoyed this game. The mechanics are pretty simple but unique. You control the older brother with the left joystick and the younger brother with the right. You can have them interact with things around the world by using the left/right triggers. Often times, you'll have to use one brother do one activity (like whistle to distract a dog) while the other does something else (like run across a field while the dog is distracted).  None of the characters speak English so the story is simple and pretty predictable but what the game lacks in plot, it makes up for with the interesting game mechanics and the absolutely stunning enviroment. Seriously, most of this game just seems like walking through an artists gallery. There are even benches throughout the game where you can sit down and enjoy the view.  My only complaint was that it was difficult to take the screen shots I wanted to take because if you were holding down buttons (for example, to sit on the bench), the screen shot wouldn't take using the controller. And I'm just not dexterous enough to hold the controller and hit the prtsc key on the keyboard.   My final recommendation is to try it out. I think this is a pretty unique game. It's not an action game but it's a cool experience and it won't take up too many hours of your time (I took my time and finished everything in about 4 hours). I would wait for it to go on sale though, because I would have been annoyed if I paid $15 for it (I paid a lot less during summer sale 2014).  Spoiler section. I'm going to talk about the very end of the game here.   The ending was predictable. With so many reviews talking about the 'feels' and how emotional the ending was, I expected someone to die and I assumed it would be the older brother. It's usually easier to have an older character die so the younger character can live on and grow from the experience.  What I didn't expect was what happened after the older brother dies. It was really gut-wrenching to control the younger brother here. Most games settle for a cut scene but this game makes you drag your brother's body into a grave and cover it with mounds of dirt. Ouch. And it was especially cool/sad how the younger brother finally learns how to swim.   The only thing I didn't like was the bird/griffin thing. I guess they learned story resolution from the Lord of the Rings / Hobbit school of storytelling. Spend a long time traveling one direction, fly back in minutes on some winged-animals.",1,0

I have personally only encountered these issues once or twice, and that was on the bigger maps, with many enemies on-screen, and lots of particles going aboot. (mostly fire..

The orcs, in particular, look incredible and are all very individualized. What seperates this game from the Batman games and the Assassins Creed games is the Nemesis system. It is superb to get killed by an orc, have him power up and talk trash in your face as you die, and then pop up out of nowhere at random to gloat about his victory and try to kill you again.   Incredibly fun, great graphics, you get to kill orcs, orcs get to kill you, and it's set in the Lord of the Rings universe. 10/10 Enjoyed every second of this game.",1,0

The games graphics aren’t much different in this remastered version, and if you already own a copy of the original game then it would be pointless to buy. However, if you have yet to play this glorious RPG, then now is the perfect time to jump in. And if you have never played with the official high-res texture add-on, the visual difference between the two Skyrims is honestly minor, and most of the improvements can be achieved or even bettered by adding ENB or SweetFX to Old Skyrim. There is also the very strong chance that your age-old Skyrim saves will not be supported by the Special Edition. Overall the game is amazing!",1,0

449830,NA,"Muv-Luv contains the first two parts (Extra and Unlimited) of an amazing visual novel series that tops the favorites list of countless fans. Degica has made some fantastic improvements in art and technical quality to go along with a retranslation of the original fan work that made Muv Luv famous.  The series as a whole shifts from slice of life romantic comedy to hardcore science fiction, taking characters you already know from a normal setting and putting them in a world where humanity is on the brink of extinction and human-piloted mechs are their only hope for survival. There’s plenty of action and emotion in the latter two parts, while the first focuses on romance and comedy, and you should definitely play them all in order to get to know the characters.    Muv-Luv Extra is a mixture of normal comedy, hilarious exaggerations and absurd truths that will probably keep you laughing for most of its length. Some might describe it as a run-of-the-mill rom-com but it sets the scene for other instalments in the series and I personally find it to be great fun.  If you thought the Muv-Luv series itself was entirely romance and comedy, though, you would be horribly wrong. Unlimited launches the characters introduced by Extra into a sci-fi mecha setting where humanity is on the brink of extinction at the hands of the terrifying BETA. Seeing those characters you've built connections with face the adversity of unadulterated war is hugely entertaining, and Unlimited is still only setting up for the amazing final chapter of Muv Luv Alternative.  Of all of the visual novels, video games, TV series, movies and books i've read before, Muv Luv Alternative sits at the top of the list in terms of sheer entertainment value and Muv Luv is the game that paves the way for it. Any fan of science fiction in general -needs- this story in their collection.",1,1
476510,Cally's Trials,"OK! After I have unlocked every weapon, ability, level , boss, all weapons are level 10, ive been level 20 for ages now.... I can say this game is great,few reasons why...  * Progression through abiities and weapons + upgrades * Traditional dungeon crawl , lots of loot to find, enemies to defeat  * The shortcuts to levels you have beaten bosses of, are very needed. * The combonation of swordplay + guns  * Variety in enemies means different strategies for each one  * shotgun is great! until you get boomerang :3 * It;s a cute game, has to be said.  Here's a few downsides.  * The levels are LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG.  Very very long. Mind-numbingly long.  My suggestion on this is buy those level shortcuts asap so you arent trudging through all 110 levels every time you die.  * Some weapons don't work on some bosses, mainly the bomb gun, and boomerang. I can see why certain weps dnot work on bosses, but.... the chain saw gun works on EVERY boss, and can decimate every boss, in literally no time at all if you fire fast enough....which leads me to my next downer abotu this game, and its a huge one.  There's no limit to the firing rate of any gun. Sounds great, right&gt;? Not really, as all you need to do is shortcut macro a key to fire ridiculous amounts of bullets, and crush through everything, I did all 6 zones (and bonus area) in about 35 minutes dong this, lol. You can;t be touched.  Devs need to cap firing rate on weps, as there's no way to prevent ppl from using turbofire.  That's all i can think of, and i wanna go after that bonus section again (another downer, there;s no shortcut to AFTER the 'final' boss, meaning if you want to challange the bonus area, you gottaq go through ALL of zone 6 ... again... kind of a bummer.  All in all, this game is fantastic, and literally consumed all of my time. I highly recommend it, as far as dungeon crawlrs go, this one is at the top .",1,0

255370,KickBeat Steam Edition,"Full review:  http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/kickbeat-steam-edition-game-review/   KickBeat (Steam Edition), a game brought to us by the same team behind Pinball FX2 and CastleStorm, is a rhythm game that places a large emphasis on reaction time and button mashing.  The game's goal is simple: last through the entire song. This is done by pressing four different buttons in a certain order pertaining to where enemies are onscreen. I used an Xbox 360 controller (so much easier) for my play sessions so far and I'd recommend one here, as the keyboard controls can get a bit frustrating. Using an Xbox 360 controller, picture the character standing in the middle of the A-X-Y-B buttons, now imagine enemies coming at you from any of those four buttons. Press the correct button in time (when the enemy is standing on it, about to attack you) to knock him out by way of some very nice Kung-Fu action.  This can get a bit more difficult if there's multiple enemies attacking simultaneously, forcing the player to react by pressing the buttons in accordance with which buttons the attackers are currently standing on. This gets even more intense later on when you've got five or so enemies attacking you every second. The game does have multiple difficult levels, however, so it shouldn't be too much of a problem to find the right difficulty for you. I went with 'Expert' to begin with, which isn't even the hardest difficulty, and I found it near-impossible to finish a song. I ended up staying with 'hard', as that was the only one I could actually go through with.  I was a bit disappointing to know that I couldn't jump right into the game and use my own music, however. A certain portion of the campaign must be completed in order to unlock the 'use your music' mode, which I would have greatly preferred to have used from the start. The campaign is fun though, so I didn't have to go through too much pain.  KickBeat is an excellent rhythm game overall. Very fun and very intense (especially on the harder difficulties, of which 'Master' is impossible). Highly recommended.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwHkG-WmbyM",1,0

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a fantastic sequel to a also fantastic game. The meat of this game comes with the huge amount of replayability; unlockable bosses, hundreds of items, many unlockable items and secrets.  Although difficult, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a highly recommended rogue-like game. I've hardly seen anybody who doesn't like it, but they exist... They just, hide under a rock or something, I dunno. They're rare, okay?  Anyway, about the reasons this game will earn at least a 8/10 as the final verdict: First off, the enemies.  There are many, many enemies in this game. Some are damn annoying, but even though they're annoying you have to give it to the designers: They're well made and have cool weaknesses to defeat.   Second off: The combat system. At first it seems very basic; you shoot tears in a direction, either up, down, left or right. But actually, as you begin to start getting upgrades, it will change more complicated. Heck, there's one item that makes you shoot SCYTHES instead of tears, how cool is that?  Third off: Replayability. If you want replayability, gosh does this game have it. You will have way over 1000 runs, mostly unique. Also as you play on and defeat bosses, you'll unlock new levels and bosses which then let you unlock more items depending on which character you killed which boss with. For example:  Character A defeats Boss B, Character A unlocks Book of Anguish.  However, when Character B defeats Boss B, Character B unlocks Double Shot instead of Book of Anguish which Character A would have unlocked if they had defeated Boss B instead. See? Two completely different items.  Fourth of all: The smoothness and mobility of this game is amazing. You can map all your controls, there's gamepad support, there's a 'flash filter' and don't quote me on this but seeing as all the teasers Edmund and the crew have been giving out, it may come out on many consoles.  BUT PLEASE TAKE IN NOTE: You cannot use your mouse to shoot tears anymore, which is quite a bummer and is actually a flaw. If this gets fixed and either I notice it or someone tells me, I'll remove this section from the review.  Fifth: It has good graphics. It may look like just a pixel game, which it kind of is, but actually there's a lot of shaders, etc in the game.  Overall this is a great game and has hardly any flaws in my opinion. It's just... Amazing.  The final verdict is a 9/10. Why do I keep reviewing such amazing games? Well, I highly recommed this game. You will love it.",1,0

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"*Note* This review is from playing it as an Alpha tester. This is not from the point of playing it recently.   I would recommend it, but not strongly, and not by any means would I vote it as good. 3 things make it not worth it right now.    1: Requirements.  Yes, yes, it's true! Better PC = Better Games. Now, this game is the exception. I got on the lowest settings for the game a solid 12-15 FPS. Now, that being said. I'm running on 8GB of RAM and a 3.1MHz Accelerated Processor. This game is good, but not worth the bells and whistles needed for it.  2: Price  I know, and you may also know, I got the game 100% free. (Alpha testers get pre-release access and a free copy) That is no consolation for the 60 dollar price tag. It was far over hyped, and didn't change the playing field enough. You can buy COD: Ghosts and play Extinction for the same Replay Value, lower price, and a whole extra game waiting for you.   3: Innovation  Shocker, the creators of L4D decide to make an FPS based around 4 characters, hunting or killing a lot of something. *cough* L4D's exact play style *cough*. Now, no disrespect, but this kind of thing is a one trick pony. Once you know the map, you know where everything is, and how to defeat it or get it. The only innovation was making the hunted not just some lame A.I. and giving the controls to a human.",-1,0

Whether you are building some contraption or playing a gamemode with your friend (or a mix of both, in some situations), it is probably one of the best games I have ever played. You can lay round with what you start with when you first install the game, trying to build something with the tools you're given, or you can go the Workshop and download a ton of props, SWEPS, Gamemodes, Tools, Scars, and more. The controls are simple and easy to learn and the stuff you can do when you overcome the basics is amazing. Although you may come across some missing textures or errors, you can buy CS:GO (Which is only like $10 or something) to fix it. I love Gmod in all its glory and splendor. 10/10 Would play again for the rest of eternity.",1,0
239030,"Papers, Please",94/100. When 'simple' means great.  Pro: - Addictive gameplay. - Learning curve not straight as it may appear at a first look. - Great atmosphere sustained only by short dialogues and a few lines of text. - Always running out of time (or this is a cons?).  Cons: - I've already played it.  Recommended to everyone who are not scared from (a great) C64 graphic style and looks for something different from the average AAA title.,1,0

This game has several exploits related to dragging the mouse during swings to pull off attacks which should not be possible. It looks stupid (breaking immsersion) and it's gamebreaking because it bypasses the games built in balance system by allowing slow heavy-damage attacks to be used quickly and with small chance of a punish. The community has embraced these exploits and the developers have left them in the game on the grounds that they take practice or 'skill.' But the truth of the matter is that they ruin what would otherwise be an amazing title for anyone who wants a game with semi-authentic medieval warfare. Basically you are forced to use these exploits if you want to compete and it just ruins the fun. Not reccomended.",-1,0

Some say the gaming industry is going down hill and to them I say, 'oh puppy ♥♥♥♥ you know nothing'. Also the game is on the new Five Guys Burger N' Fries™ engine so it is automatically good. I believe the youth of today can learn a lot about the entire gaming industry by playing a masteriece such as this. Depression Quest has restored my faith in game developement.",1,1
241560,The Crew,"The Crew has its ups and downs. I can't quite recommend it, but it's worth picking up when on a deep sale.  First off, the main character is an utter and complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Normally this isn't a big deal, but the combination of hipster look (thick rim glasses and babyface beard to start with), juvenile 'badass' nature, and above and beyond white knight philosphy make him a character that's a huge cringe to follow. And as is the case with a game like this, there's no meaningful characters or plot to really make it redeemable. I wouldn't even bother mentioning this if he wasn't constantly thrust in front of you before every mission, whining about something.  The physics of a racing game are paramount to whether the game will be enjoyable or not. And The Crew bounces around in this area. Going off road feels slightly slippery in some car classes, along with a large amount of speed lost. In fact it feels like you get a speed cap when you go offroad more than the terrain is actually factoring into the slow down. Being on road seems to have a similar cap. Turning and other physics can be best described as semi-arcade. This isn't Need For Speed and you won't be drifting around turns, at least not quickly. But this also isn't demanding like Forza. It's a nice design that makes a fun time for an evening where you just want some lazy racing.  You've got a few classes of cars to use, where each car can be in a couple of those classes. It sounds like a nice variety, but you become deeply conservative about car choice because you'll be extremely limited on funds the whole game. The cars themselves are pretty standard fare and licensed. It is interesting to see a Mustang go from a street mod racer to an offroad rally car to a monster truck (for DLC The Run), but that novelty will either be rare or you will have grinded or purchased premium currency to make it worthwhile to play with.  Plot and story are shallow. Main character's brother gets shot. Main character gets accused and put away for years. FBI wants him to bust another agent and has him get on the good side of his old gang, which no longer recognizes him even though his own brother built it up and ran it. You do some racing, move up in the ranks, half the time getting threatened to be killed, and seek revenge for a death that you pretty much don't care about with a character you just can't sympathize with. Other characters you meet are equally shallow. Basic, generic characters that have specif talents and knowledge that you use them for.  There's a lot of content to explore in the game. It takes a long time to drive one coast to the other, which isn't quite the route the game takes you. More of a clockwise path from the midwest. And along the way there's a range of activities to follow. Skill gates that have you do various activies such as slolam between markers or try to stay on a given path that gradually thins as you succeed are dotted all across the map. Hidden cars can be found once you have all the parts of a specific one in each region. Radar stations allow you to see locations you haven't spotted. And many, many events to take part in between story and a few smatterings of missions that need to be done to 'gain enough rep' to move on.  You primarily move on by gaining levels, getting better parts for your cars which also run based on levels, and progressing the story.   Even with that, something about the game feels so empty. A lobby of people that can be anywhere on the map has been, in my experience, lacking any objective. Police activity is rare. In fact trying to hunt down a chase is a pretty fruitless endeavor, and the chases are standard fare, leaning to the easier end. You'll move into a pattern of doing some mission, doing some events to get some better car parts, maybe a little exploring, then back to the grind. This isn't a bad thing usually, but there's something about The Crew that you just can't place why it feels so empty, even when its brimming with some interesting gameplay. There isn't any motivation to pursue the story in of itself and halfway through the game you already know what's coming.  It's not worth full price, but consider grabbing it on a Steam sale. Just watch out for the premium currency concerns as well. They're not needed if you are careful or don't mind grinding.",-1,1

The story is great, the athmosphere is amazing and I really liked the graphics (despite being really sick of pixel art in general). There is something hypnotic about the background animations, like water dripping from a drain pipe etc. Great detail.  There where a few down sides though. There is a bit of pixel hunting, which comes with the territory I guess. Also, the entire game spans only a few locations. It works well, but it does feel a bit reused at some point.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"This game is intense. Intense in the fact that it can touch both sides of the spectrum : One being helpless and terrified and the other feeling a sense of tremendous guilty pleasure when stabing a helpless survivor.  I would like to think of this game as a really good horror film that lingers on in your mind for weeks after the fact and for a horror movie enthusiast I more than welcome this. It has a really unique set of characters (Mostly from the killer aspect) and a really fun objective orientated style gameplay both for the killer and the surivors. When you combine these two elements with the amazing settings of the maps you get a really good product.  One of the best reasons why I personally like this game aside from the actual gameplay and amazing detail into character/map design is the fact that ping isn't a major factor in this game. As a person living in South Africa I can firmly say that I play an abundance of online competitive games with a 200-250 ping handicap, and it's increadibly frustrating. However, in this game it isn't the case, ping hardly affects me and I can play without this handicap and it feels great. Don't get me wrong I obviously still have that ping, but it isn't a major factor.   There are a few issues I have with this game though. 1: The bugs, the bugs with mostly the trapper killer and the survivor being bugged in a trap whilst rescuing their friend. It really destroys the mood however funny it may be the first 1-3 times it happens. This is just 1 of the most common bugs I have come across and it really destroys both the immersive experience as well as that current game. There are a few more bugs but its best not to divulge further into them or else I would be nit-picking. 2: Alot of disconnecting randomly for no reason, due to 'anti-cheat'. Followed the solutions people came up with and yes fair enough they worked to a certain extent, but only to have the game disconnect 3 games following.  3: Matchmaking; The matchmaking in this game feels really inconsistent. I will be in a group of 20 ranked survivors from fresh installs only to have a rank 1 killer with a long list of perks and experience. Yes, I know how matchmaking works and it's not the easiest thing to do with 100% efficiency but that seems odd, especially since it happens more than 50% of the time to me and my group of friends.  All that aside, the game feels and looks great and I really hope the devs keep releasing new content that we all could get excited for.  I would highly recommend this game if you're a fan of horror games that are done properly that can give you a good scare even after your 50th time playing it.  If I were to give this a numeral rating I would say 7/10.",1,0

398850,Epistory - Typing Chronicles,"Comparative review: Bastion meets Typing of the Dead with a touch of Zelda.  It tells its story in a very interesting way. Literally a storybook that's being created as you move about the world. The core mechanic is switching into a 'typing mode' and quickly typing out words hovering over the environment, chests, and enemies. Typing quickly extends a combo meter and when the meter is finished, it adds XP to your level bar. The XP bar gates abilities and places you can go. As you unlock new areas, new dungeons are discovered. Within these dungeons are 'tools' that grant you new special abilities. The two I've encountered so far is my attacks/typing are now Fire &amp; Ice based. By entering 'typing mode' I can switch between them by typing 'fire' or 'ice'. Fire burns enemies after the first correctly spelled word (most enemies take two words to defeat) and Ice will stop an enemy for a period of time. Since your character dies after being touched by an enemy, combat consists of using your typing skills to pick the right targets and switching between your two attacks.  My only criticism is that the movement is a little clunky. It Tries to teach you an alternative control screen at the start of the game but I found myself naturally using WASD to move. It works well enough and you can quickly put points into movement speed (and a sprint skill) but traversing the world feels very rigid.  Apparently the difficulty adjusts as you play the game. The worse you are at typing, the easier the words are. I spend my entire day typing so I'm getting some very long and difficult words thrown at me. There have been a few occasions where part of a word was not inputted since I was typing too fast. This isn't a normal occurrence, however.  Did I mention you are a young girl riding around on a fox being narrated by a the author writing a book? I probably should have mentioned that.  I really recommend this. Despite it being very Bastion, it's incredibly unique.",1,0

105600,Terraria,"I was a software author back in the early 90's on the Atari ST. Sold many games/utilities etc. I have been involved in games since the very beginning. ZX81 etc right up to modern day PC and console games. Played a wide variety of games in the last 30+ years, and I have to say that Terraria is one of the best EVER games I have ever come across. I purchased this game for myself and for my Mrs and my Grandaughter. Now it's a regular thing playing this game with my Grandaughter who lives over 70 miles away from me, while talking to me through Skype at the same time. She is 9 yrs old and she loves this to bits! Don't let the simplistic looking graphics fool you. Terraria has amazing gameplay that in my view should last me and my family a few YEARS! Single player is fun, buy multiplayer is truly awesome. I also like the humour that the author has put into Terraria, from the funny zombie sounds to the floating eyeballs and the hundreds of various items that can be found or crafted in the game. Believe me, this game will last you a hell of a long time, and the asking price is easily worth it. I actually got this during the recent Steam Sale for around £1.49. But if I'd of known how good this game really was beforehand, I would have no problem whatsoever paying the usual price. Beats all these £40+ games with fancy graphics that don't last more than a couple of weeks before you've completed them!  My advice. Simple.  BUY IT!!  Incidentally, I have recently purchased Starbound, and at this moment in time (in my view) Terraria blows it away! However, this may change as updates come out. If you have purchased Starbound first, and didn't like it that much, then don't think that Terraria is exactly the same, it's not. Better graphics and I think easier to get into. But that's just my opinion.... oh yes... and my Grandaughter's. :D",1,0

324610,The Shopkeeper,"The game started off as a harmless game with vaguely entertaining undertones. Something to spend an hour , before moving on to other matters.  Little did I know what broiling, seething, endless amounts of hatred this game would inspire. The voice acting is grating and repetitive. It is easily ignored at first, but after a while you hear them say the exact same thing over and over again. There are limited choices you see, and each of them as meaningless as the last.   What item you choose in the shop means nothing. It just has a meaningless bit of trivia attached to it. One you will hear over and over again, as sometimes seemingly at random you will start outside of the store and instead of going in, the game chooses an item for you. You start knowing each item by heart and hating yourself for it.   The dialogue with the mother in law is equally meaningless. The only ending in the game which seems remotely entertaining is where she dies. None of the characters are remotely interesting or evoke the slightest bit of sympathy or engagement. The protagonist is a shiftless, whiny, useless man who his wife probably married to spite her mother. Understandable, as the mother is a shrill harpy whose voice slowly makes one wish for blunt cranial trauma. The best character is the shopkeeper, for he is only ineffectual instead of being an outright blight on humanity. To add injury to insult, I think I made the characters twice as interesting as they are in the actual game..   To make this game palatable, I would suggest the following.   1. If one is outside the store, allow one to simply skip to be within it. You already heard everything the flower shop guy had to say.  2. Always allow one to choose your item. That is the point yes?  3. Let people change perspective themselves.   4. Provide subtitles  5. Allow one to skip dialogue if it is the exact same. clicking through simply isn't fast enough.   In short, strive to not waste people's time with the game.   Although in hindsight a letter of apology for releasing the game would seem the better option.",-1,0

341020,Chronicles of Teddy,"This game is very reminiscent of Metroid and Zelda (Zelda II: The Adventure of Link to be specific) and it plays great. The controls are tight and combat fun. When you use the jump + down attack you bounce off their head like a trampoline which leads to some bouncy combos. The dungeons like dungeons within dungeons. Your hub world has rooms to unlock as you collect different abilities and encourages revisiting old areas to get to previously hard to reach treasure boxes. The pixel art and effects are smooth as butter and make the world very attractive to look at. There are no tutorials, no map system (Which I admittedly wish we had) so you can't use the complaint 'Video games try too hard to hold your hand' because this game definitely lets you fend for yourself. Finding Teddy II is a great game with awesome visuals and gameplay. I highly recommend it.",1,0

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"A modern day masterpiece.  Im not new to the series having previously done everything possible in Demon Souls....I'd went several NG+ deep, held every weapon, reached well in excess of SL250 and farmed souls to the point where losing 4 million souls meant absolutely nothing, all as part of a 15-20 hour search just for the ever elusive Pure Bladestone.   Dark Souls does everything Demon Souls did but on a grander scale. The nexus is a thing of the past with more traditional progression through the area making it feel more like a world than a series of selectable areas / levels. There's a heavy covenant theme throughout the game, many are easily missable as there well off the beaten track. There are NPCs which will sporadically pop up during your playthrough provided you fulfill very specific conditions and for the most part meet them at a set point during progression through the game.  What is retained is the outstanding sense of atmosphere. Blighttown &amp; The Depths are Dark Souls equivalent of the Valley of Defilement from Demon Souls, an area where early game you'll spend most of your time either poisoned, toxic, cursed or all three. Tomb of the Giants with its almost complete darkness hiding oversized skeletons up until the point where they attack, Darkroot Basin &amp; Darkroot Garden with Alvina the Forest Covenant leader looking like a nod to something from Alice in Wonderland. The Crystal Cave, Demon Ruins, Lost Izalith, The Catacombs, The Painted World of Ariamis, Anor Londo....there all fantastic, so unique and defined in the game world with completely unforgettable mini bosses / bosses.  The gameplay mechanics are generally as was in Demon Souls, load created by equipped items and stamina / strength stats still play a huge part, go over 50% and you fat roll, go even higher and your character will just squirm on the spot when you tap roll, mobility as before is key. If you can get to them the game throws high level armour sets and weapons at you very early on, there so high though you're unable to use them effectively. During my initial playthrough I fealt like I barely scratched the game, I used several weapons out of more than likely 50+ which reside in my inventory, used 3 or 4 armour sets, used 3 or 4 rings predominantly chosen specifically for boss fights or locations. I believe I used one spell out of a vast amount, that being Iron Flesh to tank the Sanctuary Garden boss - the scope to play the game in your own way is almost overwhelming.  To touch on the multiplayer, its still active, people still drop the old troll signs telling you to jump off cliff faces to fantastic treasure etc, for the best example of how unique the multiplayer is googling 'Dark Souls The Wall' leaves nothing to the imagination.  Very few games nowadays keep me compelled to the point where I can't put them down, Dark Souls is one of them.",1,0

Now everyone saying it's a Pay to win, but i dont think it is.

304650,Sunless Sea,"This game is really really fun but I do think its almost mandatory for you to use a mod to speed up the boat speed and everything because a few minutes in between every island is a bit much. I do suggest you at least play a small portion of it at its original speed as the game is really good at setting an eerie mood. People will say that the speed and pace is a con, but when the dev's make it so easy to change, there is no reason to gripe about it at all.  Pros  -extremely detailed world and environment -certain amount of replayability -many different victory paths and play paths -fairly challenging riddles/puzzles -lots of fun side   what people may find frustrating because its a roguelike game, roguelike fans like this though -higher learning curve -death and rng are quite common especially on the first full playthrough -exploring new areas and trying new things will probably kill you if you dont know what they do and don't prepare adequately -items/status are ambiguous for example, what may be a debuff(menace) may actually pay out more in the late game and things that help early on in the game may hurt more in the late game -surprisingly well balanced, there isn't a whole lot of abusable stuff to farm money and stuff, although good trades and options do exist and come through experience or googling it -many things to keep track of like side quests, items, travel paths  People may think that those above are cons but it is a roguelike game and to play the game with any other expectations is kinda silly. Only true con is the vanilla speed and pace of the game which is easily changed at your own discretion. I &lt;3 this game though, the story is beautiful and the story is great, the game is surprisingly indepth, and there is no way you can find everything through one playthrough, don't be afraid to google when you are stuck though, no point in beating up something you dont understand XD.",1,0

262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"I have this game since day 1 of early access realease and I watched it evolve and turn into one of the hardest games I ever played. Now with it's full release I went back and played again, willt try to finish.  Games over the course my life gave me a bad quirk, I am addicted to read reviews, recomendations, opinions and friend's word. So I went to read Steam Reviews, and what a bad decision it was... People are seriously complaining about being too hard!!!  Man, I can't even count the amount of deaths I had even in the early access, the game is sure unforgiving. Perma death, diseases, quirks and unpredictable crits are the gold of this game, the frustation is part of human life and without it, we become naive. I'll give you an exemple.  -'Wow, there's a new dungeon... Coves? Let's try it out'. So I went to my first run in the coves, in the second corridor I saw the Shambler's Altar, I read the description and decided to put a torch on it... Well, I saw that was a mistake when I got jumpscared but a tentacle monster that ate my light and spawned minions, Shambler had 77 health. Not gonna lie, fight a boss ( or mini boss ) with levels 0 was difficult, but I did it, I won, and it was so, so satisfying... I was no more naive to trust everyting I encounter  The game is about a wealthy man and his thrist for discorevy that find out that, beneath his mansion, lies unimaginable treasures waiting to be found. Well, guess what? It was like Pandora's Box, it released evil beings to the surface of the earth.  Contemplating suicide, the man writes a leater to you asking for you help, take over the town, command it to defeat the evil.    THE GAME IS DIFFICULT, IT'S SUPPOUSE TO BE!!!",1,1

353130,Time of Dragons,"There isn't much to say about this one. It is a simple but fun game.  You are a dragon, someone strapped some guns to your back and you are off fighting other dragons. The weapons have infinite ammo, but your Dragon only has limited heat capabilities, limiting how much you can fire before your guns overheat and have to cool down.  There are 3 types of secondary weapons: Plasma Ball, Rocket launcher and Railgun (Sniper). And then there are 4 'consumables', which are basically stuff like Smokescreen, Mines (invisible to the enemy) and Cooldown and Stamina injections. Each dragon has their own special ability, such as “breath fire”, “breath toxic gas” or simply “create blinding flash”. Also each dragon has different stats. Bigger dragons are slower with more guns, slower dragons are more nimble with less guns.  That is the entire game. Its an Unity Game, so don't expect to much on the graphic end, the UI is quite simple, but honestly, the flying is fun. The game isn't big and it runs on a potato.  So if you want to get your Dragon on, and enter a team deathmatch or a free for all, this game is great for that. As I said, the flying is fun and its a simple game. Pick it up, jump in and have some fun.  I think the biggest downside to this game is how simple it is. Give it a whirl, its free to play... and I haven't found a cash shop in the thing yet and already have unlocked 3 dragons after an hour.. so.. really.. what are you waiting for?",1,0

235600,Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Blacklist,"First of all: i do enjoy this game a lot. it is very well done, the story adds up perfectly and seems to be thought through all the way (it's not even THAT predictable), the game mechanics work on a quite intuitive basis and the overall product seems to be of high quality. now in my opinion there are only two things wrong with the game. the minor problem is the controls. it has it's flaws but i can live with that. maybe it would be best to play the game with a gamepad but you'd have to sacrafice some accuracy while aiming. i don't like playing shooters with gamepads and that leads to the second MAJOR problem: i don't see Splinter Cell: Blacklist as a classic splinter cell game. splinter cell is not supposed to be a shooter. it should be about stealth and trying to keep your surroundings untouched. to be clear, it is indeed possible to play the game in this way but there are many situations and many circumstances that prevent this game from feeling like a real Splinter Cell game. in the last few years i noticed a certain 'dumbing down' of all the games out there and Splinter Cell was unfortunately a victim as well. Remember when there was a meter for visibility and for your level of sound that you produce? Gone. Now all you need is a shadow. Even in brith daylight a shadow will provide enough shelter to make you invisible. Remember when you actually were able to regulate how fast Fisher was moving? You still have that but you can choose between running and sprinting. Even while crouched he 'walks' way too fast.   Those are just two examples of the things that  I THINK  are wrong with the game(you can't count the thing with the controls. it could be me being too stupid to be able to use them correctly). I was promised a similar experience to the 'old' Splinter Cell titels. Well, I was dissapointed in that sense but as I said, I still enjoyed the game. Not because it's a great Splinter Cell game but because it is a great addition to the Splinter Cell series. It feels a little like a reboot to me. FYI    the story is pretty short but awesome :P",1,0

349220,The Black Watchmen,"**Originally reviewed during season 1 (about 6 months ago), original review was rather lengthy and had been edited multiple times, decided to re-write it instead of editing again.**  Unprofessional and petty developers who basically banned me from their forums for posting a negative review of their game on steam (can't post new threads or even make posts in existing threads anymore), even though i've never broken any rules or behaved badly, normally i wouldn't give two hoots about this, except to play this game you are expected to frequent the games forums and irc.  They also decided to withhold all of my irl interactions that i was supposed to receive (that i paid for!!!!) during season 1 and 2 (i bought this on day 1 of season 1), they instead decided to operate this game like a pyramid scheme, where only the most active 10 or so players will receive any irl interactions outside of the simple phone number confirmation call and address confirmation letter, requiring you to spend 8+ hrs a day hanging around in a dead irc, waiting for a live mission to start, for weeks/months before being classed as one of these 'first tier' members, if ever.  When live missions do come around (only 5 per season and once they over you can never play them again) the community as a whole are very self centered and mainly bothered about who was the first to work out a puzzle and tell everyone else the answer, most of them unfortunately see this as 'team work', some of the mods of the forums/irc are also very obnoxious and like to shout others down to have their idea listened to over others.  Client missions suffer hugely from poor role play, purposefully confusing and misleading mission briefs (from an organisation your supposed to work for, who need your expert help...) and even just plain poor puzzles.  Personally i would advise all to stay away from these unprofessional and petty devs, but, if you're still interested as puzzle games are your thing then wait until a season is about £5 or less before purchasing, at this price point you may find some value.  New seasons are WAY overpriced (yes you have to buy them!) as you are paying for the 'first tier' players to receive phone calls and basic letters through the post for live missions, and unless you were here since the start of season 1 (I was and even I havn't received any), its pretty much guaranteed you will not be a first tier player.  Also, you do not even need to own the current season or even the game to 'take part' in the live missions, you can simply create an account on the games forums for free, waste your days in their dead irc waiting for a live mission to start and then follow along.  TL/DR - A forum based alternate reality game (that you normally find for free) thats been shoe-horned into a steam game and had its price massively inflated with the promise of IRL interactions you simply wont receive, all ran by a seemingly petty and unprofessional group of devs.",-1,0

226700,Infestation: Survivor Stories 2020,"Infestaion Survivor Stories tries to capture the new Zombie MMO genre but fails due to many flaws with the game.   The most notable flaw is the microtransactions which takes away the whole 'survival' from the game knowing that you can buy food and medical supplies that does give an unfair advantage to players who chose not to pay for virtual items, You also have to pay to revive your characters Now this wouldn't really be a problem if it were a free to play game but its not it's £11 waste of money.  Another problem with the game are the bugs and they can be game breaking, Zombies can seem to hit you when they are not very close to you and it doesn't take long for them to kill you. If you try to stand on hard to reach places the zombies sometimes stack on each other and can eventually hit you.  A big flaw in the game is how the zombies match your running speed, This matched with the fact you walk slower the more damaged you are, But the zombies seem to keep jogging on so it becomes very hard to outrun them this matched with their hit range makes the game too hard and almost unplayable.  All this negativity doesn't mean the game doesn't have some positve atributes, One thing I liked was the time capsule feature which allowed players to write a message in a tube can leave it for other players to find so this added 'Role playing' if you're into that. Also you cannot buy guns on the store which doesn't make it purely pay to win  The game still is in alpha so this could all change but it's has not had any major updates since release which makes me think the developers have abandoned the game.",-1,0

A large amount of maps ranging from abandoned and zombie-infested hospitals to desolate farmland whose only population, excluding you, have their flesh falling off.   Not only are there many maps to choose from, there are many classes to pick. Each class has different merits but not so drastic that you can go for easy xp by choosing classes that are practically tailored for specific maps.  There is the sharpshooter class which, as the name probably explains, majors in long-distance weaponry such as pistols and assault rifles. The sharpshooter is a fairly common choice amongst newcomers because of its familiarity with other shooter games. To level up this perk, which is hard like all other classes, you only need to complete a certain number of headshots on zombies, whether it be from scrakes to the gorefast, all headshots are welcome.  Secondly, there is the Field Medic class. Like all of the classes in KF they are pretty standard, The medic heals the player and comes with a few skills that are exclusive to the medic, one of these is the ability to heal players, and harm enemies, with explosives and throwable items, if a Medic throws a jar of bile and it splashes a player, it will heal them. The main way for a Medic to level up is to heal players, self-administered shots of healing aid do not count towards their level.  Next up, the Support Specialist. The Support Specialist, usually called 'Support', is a character who deals with enemies at the front lines, they tend to carry larger firepower than the rest of the crew and can be set to do any task, what classifies as support in Killing Floor is stuff like continuing the weld on doors so they don't break open and let the horde in. Support excels at stuff like this.  Let's continue, the Commando. The Commando is like the lookout tower on a ship, they have the ability to see what health the ZEDs are at, which are actually failed clones, not zombies but we'll refer to them as zombies for now. The Commando's good vision is this class's greatest asset, they can see cloaked enemies such as the stalker. The Commando's main job would be to give supressive fire for the rest of the squad, their guns have large magazine reserves so they don't need to reload very often.  Berserker, one of the hardest classes to upgrade in KF. Berserkers are the melee extraordinaires in the group, they have a natural affinity towards powerful hand-held weapons. The Zerk can use the knife (Which comes standard with each game), Machete, Fire axe, Katana, Claymore, Chainsaw, Scythe and Dwarfish axe with great skill, Berserkers are always at the front lines using their melee weapons to slaughter the zombies, keep in mind that ZEDs are strong and it is easy to get overwhelmed using this character.  Firebug, the pyromaniacs of the clan. The Firebugs are a class of horde-suppressors, their weak but high-spread arsenal are to credit for this. If you wish to take home the heads of many powerful enemies in KF then this isn't the class for you, The Firebugs are a rarely sought-after class in KF, from my experience, but can change a team from a bunch of low-level noobs to low-level noobs with a Pyromaniacs amongst them, The main perks which come under 'Firebug' are the long-ranged weapons they possess, like the flamethrower and the MAC-10. These guys can kill ranged ZEDs like the sirens easily.  Lastly, Demolition. As the name implies, Demolition men are the explosives experts amongst your crew, their naturally heavy weaponry can improve upon the overall sucess of your mission, they can demolish many enemies at once with the help with some of the power from their arsenal, like the Pipe bomb. This Class's weaponry can be expensive but highly effective against even the strongest of foes. The Demolition class have a larger inventory of both grenades and explosive weapons, like the M79 Grenade Launcher. If you wish to use this class, make sure you know a good thing about strategy in placement because the Pipe bombs aren't cheap, they range from £1500-£390.    The community for KF is very friendly and professional, like L4D, the teams you are placed in are co-dependant or, at the very least, very synchronised. I would highly recommend this game to anyone willing to spend some money on a good game, the leveling system is harsh but it is fair. Great game!",1,0

211820,Starbound,"Before I start my review, let me tell you something real quick that will either excite people, or disappoint them.  It is a sandbox game. Keep that in mind before purchasing this, kay?  Now, to start my review,  Starbound is basically what No Man's Sky should have been, just a sandbox game with stuff to do. Sure, it doesn't have the best quests, of course it's similar to Terraria since the same people who have worked on this also worked on the game everybody knows and loves. But, this game is much better with mods, and friends who have the game as well. If you just go in on your own, you will likely just have a bad experience; Reason being, is because this game was meant to be modded, and to have groups of people join together to play.  To be honest, the quests are pretty dull, but honestly they're more of a method to get you to explore the terrain more, to look more into the race's culture. Other than that, I've found nothing else that bothers me. The challenges are fun, the cosmetics are great, it's fully mod compatible, and it emphasizes on you building a really awesome base with your friends.  I don't care what anybody else thinks, I personally think that this game is awesome, and I enjoy playing this with my friends.",1,0
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"First of all, this game is unplayable on PC. Absolutely no effort was taken to port it to keyboard and mouse controls, so if you don't have a gamepad, you're completely out of luck. Case and point: They couldn't even bother to convert the UI text from pad buttons to keyboard keys, so it's up to you to figure out which key the A button is. Have fun!  Secondly, failing to properly playtest or balance your game, resulting in an awkward, merciless mess, can't simply be justified after the fact as the game being 'hardcore.' Own up to it, guys; you were trying to make a basic fantasy adventure game, screwed it up, and now you're stuck having to endorse the tiny fraction of the gaming community who declared it good because it's hard. Sorry, but having a crappy interface, clumsy controls, and poor art direction can't be explained away as 'hardcore' design choices. Nobody at your company sat there in a meeting and said 'Let's make the UI awful, people will love it because it makes the game more challenging! Then let's miserably fail to port it to PC, that'll make it even more fun for those guys!' If that's your philosophy, why not just make the game not load at all or instead just release a bunch of viruses on my computer. Reinstalling my OS would make Dark Souls REALLY hard to play! So much fun!  I love hard games, having grown up in the 80s. You 90s and 00s kids have no idea what hard is if you never tried Mega Man 1, Battletoads, Ghouls 'n Ghosts, or some of those other classics developed way back in the day. There was no hand-holding, no tutorials, and often games didn't even come with instruction manuals. Hell, it was a while before you could even save your games! So don't go telling me I dislike Dark Souls because it's too hard.",-1,0

The story is certainly interesting, but I think its progressive nature is why the game gets such favorable opinions in the press. It is a very short experience (~2 hours). If I paid full price for this, then I'd be a little perturbed, but considering I got it in a Humble Bundle, I came away thinking of it as a decent point and click interactive novel. Also the voice actor for Sam is fabulous.   Thumbs up because I didn't pay $20 for it. If I had paid $20 for it, then thumbs down. Value plays a huge part in this one.",1,0

230410,Warframe,"This game has a nice style to it, blending a mission based RPG-like style with 3rd person shooting and epic melee weapon fighting and parkour. Theres about 20 classes to pick from, 3 to choose when starting the game and the others you have to build. If you want to play this game it will take a bit of a time investment, and sadly a lot of things in the game make me believe its created by EA (too many things cost real money) but it's worth it in my opinion. Every item that you can build takes real time, adding an interesting quirk to the game. It's very fun to run on walls and jump off assisnating the first enemy you see and continue flying around guns blazing killing everyone to comeplete the mission, or if it fits your style more, you can also do the whole mission stealthy. The game even lets you hack the alarm system to regain stealth in case you get caught. I almost forgot to mention the graphics... 9/10 grahpics. It looks beautiful and the design of items and character models is amazing. One thing, always turn off verticle sync in the display settings. If you dont, the game will lag for no reason. Overal amazing game but takes a bit of a time investment to get your stuff personalized (Getting the class, or 'warframe', that you want, getting the weapons you want, etc).",1,0

You may like it more than me if you're a story fan, but a game with only story gets boring.

You start off on a journey throughout the island where your main objective will be to collect items of value which in turn can be used to explore further i.e. opening doors, safes and lighting up dark places. Your goal is to discover why the girl and her family where living there, though essentially none of your business but nevertheless, you're obliged to try and solve things for the better.  I say it's none of Jeremy's business because this is what I would rather have expected from this game: If Jeremy is stranded on an island and if he is the actual character in turmoil then why bother listening to dead people's voices. I would have liked to see Jeremy play the survival game in order to get of the island safely. Yeah, throwing in a few ghosts along the way could've brought some suspense and mystery to the whole scenario for sure, but Jeremy's hide still had life, vigor and spirit in.    And in the end...   He did manage to get off the island though, with the help of a cookbook and a two-way radio and after he has read Anna's whole life story in another book...  As far as gameplay mechanics, frame rates, mouse movements are concerned there is rather little to be said, but then again, it's a free game, takes about two hours to complete and you'll get nine Steam achievements. That's it. I recommend playing this title.",1,0

251470,TowerFall Ascension,"TowerFall is a game that is timeless. Don't let it's looks decieve you. This is a skill based, reaction heavy, action platformer that is best played against your  best  enemies (friends). This is best played with 3 friends. The only warning I have is to prepare for a noise complaint because you  will  be yelling.  This is very skill based. You are an archer equipped with a finite number of arrows. There are upgrades and different TYPES of arrows to try to reach before your most hated foes (friends :)). You must be the last man standing, yet the game is based on SCORE. Therefore you must choose between going all-in or hanging back and playing defensive.   You have the highest score. A flurry of arrows fly in your direction. What do you do?! Evade into the arrows, catching them! Now not only do you have more arrows than your enemy, but you're above them as well. You wall slide gracefully and plop on your friend's head almost in slow motion. Splat. Two more to go...  That all happens within a second's time. TowerFall is ridiculously intense and thrilling. Arrows missed will be left pierced into the ground or wall, waiting to be picked up. There's so many things I can say about TowerFall but I just highly recommend buying it and doing a good old fasioned party night with your friends. You'll see the value immediately.  Note : Make sure everyone has a controller. I've been the one person playing on a keyboard and it's torture and just feels plain unfair.  There are a few multiplayer modes: -Last man standing -First to '#blank' kills -Team deathmatch  As well as probably about 100 game modifiers.",1,0

257350,Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition,"I love Baldur's Gate II; I've been playing it for years, and I adore Infinity Engine games in general. However, I cannot give Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition an unconditional recommendation. For $25, this game comes with very little in the way of improvements or enhancements. I understand copyright issues have prevented Beamdog from making substantial changes to the game, so you'll find no HD graphics, no achievements, no major bugfixes, no sweeping changes to the game and little new content.  What you do get is a faithful and functioning game with four well-designed new NPCs, a number of interesting new kits (Shadowdancer is especially powerful) and a robust multiplayer system. If this is enough for you, and you enjoy old-school 2nd Edition D&amp;D games, I can recommend this game if it's ever on sale. Just don't expect an overhaul, improved graphics or anything similar.",1,0

292730,Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare,"Performance was extremely good on my R9 390 + i5 6500. Single player campaign is freaking epic, worth the pricetag by itself. Experienced one crash, didn't really bother me too much, I was freaked out that I'd have to start the mission over but instead picked up exactly where I crashed. Multiplayer is alright, it's not new, and it's not perfect, but it's not terrible.  Here's my take: CoD IW is effectively what everyone waiting for Squardron 42 is wanting, and they did an excellent job at creating a well done, relatively optimized, single player campaign; however, the fighter/space combat is downright terrible. But let's face it, it's better than SC's current space combat, and it exists in playable form today (while SQ42 doesn't yet). I think this game is a good way to tide yourself over while you wait, and that's pretty much what most games end up being anyways.  Fair warning: Multiplayer seems to be most heavily based on rock/paper/scissors at time, and not even remotely on skill (or maybe I'm being matched well with relatively equally skilled players, in which case 'neat!') If you're prone to ragequitting, the MP is probably not for you, but that's okay because we're all different types of gamers, and not all games appeal to everyone.  I think a lot of the negative reviews are blown out of proportion.  While I won't recommend you buy the game if you're on the fence, I would recommend it if you were planning on it but put off by bad reviews.  If I had to give the multiplayer a rating it would be 6.5 out of 10. If I had to give the campaign a rating it would be 9.5 out of 10.",1,0

213670,South Park™: The Stick of Truth™,"This was one of my favorite games in recent memory. What happens when you take the brilliance of Parker and Stone and pair it with the masterful skill of Obsidian Entertainment? This game.  This is an RPG that features a more old school style combat system, where timing is as important as upgrades and buffs. Speaking of RPG, it in itself is simple and yet maximizes what it intended to accomplish, and your guy will be a bad ### by the end of the game. Speaking of your guy, if you DON'T name him '♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥', you aren't doing things properly, lol  Anyway, playing through this game is basically like playing through an entire season of the TV show itself, with all the twists and turns a season might take. The town of South Park and all its inhabitants show up and are presented perfectly. The plot itself is also fairly well perfect, and I dare say that even if you aren't a fan of the show, you will still love this game.  For me, this was easily a 10 out of 10. Cant recommend this one highly enough really.  It's also worth noting that this game has a ton of replay value, not only for all the copious Easter Eggs, but also because the second playthrough will allow you choices that perhaps weren't available the first time around, and will also allow you to take different paths in the game as well (story choices, interactions, etc...) that have different consequences.",1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,"This game is pretty low quality in general. Graphics are bad, shooting is bad, balance is bad, and some of the mechanics are bad.

45700,Devil May Cry 4,"With the upcoming Special Edition, I can't say I suggest you buy this version.  But, it's one of the best games of all time. Hindered in many ways by production, it fell short of what it could have been, with the backtracking and all the junk I'm sure is mentioned elsewhere in other reviews. That said, even with its flaws, it's simply one of the deepest combat systems one can find, especially on the PC. Arguably worse than Devil May Cry 3 in some respects, but honestly the PC version of DMC3 is junk. Move along on that one.  I could write essays about this game, spending much more time on it for the 360 originally, and sadly being a bit burnt out by the time I played it on PC which is the definitive version. I won't be writing those essays, and I'll sum it up right quick:  Play this game, wait for the special edition, but play it. You can't do any more of a disservice to yourself than to ignore one of the best series to ever grace video games. It's what games should be, giving the player freedom to create, rather than giving stagnant dial a combo gameplay seen in too many other games.",1,0

105600,Terraria,"It is similar to minecraft in spirit, but it should not be judged in that way. Terraria itself is a different game on its own apart from its equally well-known counterpart. With an 8-bit look and more focus on gameplay elements, it can be downright addicting. With every new patch, it gets slightly more improved. You may fancy yourself untouchable after collecting certain materials to craft powerful gear, but once you reach hardmode it's a whole different story.  Overall, I would recommend it this game to anyone who likes sandbox games, especially a game that may be influenced by minecraft without being an apparent rip-off. With its quirky charm, retro look, and solid gameplay, who wouldn't like this game?",1,0

297130,Titan Souls,"Bare bones story, very difficult, controller only, great music and fantastic bosses. This would be the way I choose to describe Titan Souls.  So let's get into it shall we?  Bare Bones Story: Far as I know we the player need to kill these Titans because reasons. Okay, got it. Good enough for me.  Very Difficult: The Titans are relentless and each has their own flavour of how they fight. It will take some time to learn how they move and their attacks, but once the player sees the Titan's weak point they must think of the best way to hit that weak point.  Controller Only: My only 'real' complaint is that it requires a controller to play. How I own one so it was not as big of a deal as it could have been for someone else.  Great Music: Just, just look up the OST on YouTube. Some great tunes to listen to when travelling this very foreign world.   Great Bosses: The only enemies you face in this game are the Titans. The beings you, the player, must kill if you wish to progress. Little is known from these Titans, but each area they inhabit provides a bit of backstory to who and what these Titans are in every area. It might take a little reading between the lines and sometimes it might seem a little obvious. Looking at you Eye. Heart, Brain and Body Titans &gt;_&gt;  I am not very far into the game at the moment of writing this and I hope to expand on this review later on, but for now I am mighty pleased with just how difficult it is. You got one arrow and very little information, forcing the player to think on their own and think fast on how to kill the Titans.

Having played the board game, I enjoyed this adaptaion immensely.  This game had a bit of an XCOM feel to it, which is a great sign IMO.  Ascenion can essentially be described as a turn based grid tactical rpg survival horror in space with Space Knights/Vampire/Werewolves fighting xenmorphs. Derp. It's still pretty good.  Pros: Solid combat. Really makes you think with your tactics. A great adaptation that catches the feel of the board game, while also being its own distinct game. RPG mechanics work well, you can grow attached to your squads. Good atmosphere. Music. Gameplay length is awesome for the price.  Cons: Limited Space Marine dialogue that kinda gets old and bland quickly. Visuals are meh and murky. Some cheap deaths. Some game breaks where you can literally camp and just wait until Genestealers are dead.  Overall, this is a reccomendation for 40K fans and everyone who likes turn based combat. Normal gamers won't find anything too special, but the price is low enough with good replay value.  Overall score: 7.8/10",1,0
40700,Machinarium,"Machinarium is a beautiful and maybe a bit short graphic adventure in which we control a nameless little robot trying to get back to its home city and learning why he got expelled from it in the first place.  With a great and unique artistic style and no dialogues, Machinarium almost always manages to comunicate the player 'what does he need to do next', although there are some points in the story in which the in-game help (Through both hints and a total solution for a puzzle, unlockable through a mini-game that you have to beat each time you want to check it so you don't have instant access to it) is kind of needed, as the next objective is not too clear.  The puzzles are not too hard to solve, although some of them are challenging enough to get stuck on them for some time (Which is kind of the point in this type of games), and they are usually 'logical' puzzles (Sliders, buttons, etc) with even some mini-games (A space invaders clone, a small top-down shooter game..) to add some variety to our little robot's adventure.  Machinarium is a charming adventure game, with emphasis on logical puzzles more than in the 'mix items A and B to get C to open door D' formula and an adjusted difficulty to provide a nice challenge while not making the player go crazy. A great addition to anyone's game collection.  Also, I blame Amanita design for not selling a toy of the little robot :(",1,0

25830,Knights of Honor,"OMG! I almost conquer all Europe, just Sweden (North-East) and the Russia side (east)... but sunddenly my king die and ALL my region become independent!! I lost over 50+ regions, how that possible?? (my king have died by age)  It is good idea that the king die because getting old and so... but the problem is that they don't get any child often, and the throne end up in one of the marshals (general). Oh! and usually that marshals is in your comand for long time too, so he will die again before he can have a child...  There are limited amount of marshal you can have... This is bad because:   -To be able to trade, you need a marshal to do so... The merchant can't command an army, he can only trade with ONE ally at a time!!   -All captured (prisoner), either from your side or the enemy occupies space.

425340,Space Moth DX,"This is great. Has a lovely, hypnotic, trancey, laid back feel to it.  Has a really good scoring mechanic where you 'soul drain' larger enemies by hitting them with your wide/rapid shot until they turn black, and then finish them off with your laser to score higher.  soul drained enemies become more aggressive, firing out more bullets, so it's a lovely risk/reward system.  A lot of bullets home in on you in this game so you can't just be flying all over the screen, you have to stand still when you need to.  Nice bright, chunky, primary coloured graphics take you back to playschool. Some great, tricky bosses, especially that final one.  Really good game, though some of the bosses can't be good for my blood pressure. I'd like to meet the guy who thought up the final boss and shake him by the neck. Finally beat it today though :D",1,0

208200,DOOM 3: BFG Edition,"The BFG edition of Doom 3 actually legitimately surprised me. It includes both Doom 3, it's expansion, and it's prior games Doom 1 and 2. Doom 3 has been treated with a slight facelift, most of the models are identical albiet with new textures. The game has also been updated in general for modern operating systems and with higher resolutions.  Now for the downsides, similar to Rage Doom 3 doesn't allow you to change your graphic options. Which is fine by me since it is a 8 year old game practically anyone can run on max today. They patched in the ability to alter the FOV and the framerate, so pretty much the only thing this port is missing is mod support.  As for Doom 1 and 2, you cannot change your keybindings, nor can you alter many of the options like in the original games. On the plus side, Doom 2 includes the added content from the 360 port. So it includes a smashing set of 6 levels for classic Doom gameplay.  Really you either hated Doom 3 or loved it, personally I welcome the changes.",1,0

381210,Dead by Daylight,"Buggy but fun nonetheless. There are some issues that need attention such as getting stuck in ditches and random crashes for survivors if they escape, but if the game plays normal, it can be really fun.  Personally, I have a small list of criteria that, if met, makes the game amazing:  1) Obviously, no crashes or ditch squatting bugs and stuff like that  2) Your team has some sense of self-preservation (a lot of my teams seem to have people get hooked immediately once the game starts)  3) The killer isn't a camper (I still don't understand why the cheapest and most hated of all video game tactics is encouraged by the developers, one of the killers is pretty much designed to be a camper (it's the wraith))  List of other problems: -ranked system doesn't work -wiggling out of the killer's grasp takes waaaaaay too long even if the killer doesn't have the perk making wiggle take longer (also where are wiggle points???) -I lost one of those little rank pip things because the killer quit the game (that one may just be me though) -(This one is total opinion) the game isn't scary (and I am a very easily spooked individual), but I will admit I was jump startled by a passing survivor when I played killer the other day -wraith sometimes ceases to function when picking up survivor (maybe fixed? I'm not sure) -dropping barricade on killer's head sometimes forces you to move to side of barricade you did not wish to go to (and that isn't just me, it happened to several survivors I was killing) -(I don't think this one counts but I'm putting it in anyway because it is always what gets me killed) skill checks that MUST be performed the INSTANT that you hear the sound cue  A lot of this review has just been me whining about stuff so here's something totally unbiased:  Great game, play only if you: hate people with a passion, like the sound of hearts beating, and can sleep soundly knowing you left your best friend to die at the hands of a camper",1,0

There are a few differences in gameplay that really enhance your enjoyment as well.

232090,Killing Floor 2,"Things KF2 Does Right: -Best Gunplay  Most of KF2's guns are just a joy to shoot. Guns feel punchy and responsive. -Amazing gore system  This ♥♥♥♥ makes melee/gunplay so much more satisfying. This is easily the biggest improvement over KF1. -God-tier Animations  The first and even third person animations are the best I've ever seen in a FPS.  -Non-Artificial Difficulty  KF2 ramps up the difficulty but it's done without turning zeds into bullet sponges. Instead, Tripwire gives zeds additional abilities in higher difficulties. Husks gain suicide bombs and flamethrowers, Stalkers start backflipping everywhere, certain zeds start blocking, etc. The realistic animations for zeds makes getting headshots a lot harder compared to KF1 but it never feels like it wasn't your own fault. -Sound Design  Most of the sounds in KF2 are great. The gore sounds are meaty and are a huge part of what makes the gore so damn satisfying. HOWEVER, some of the gun firing sounds are just abysmal, the sound mixing can be real bad, zeds don't talk, and the already tiny amount of banter between characters is barely audible.  Things KF1 Did but KF2 Doesn't: -Atmosphere and Charm  Incoming wall of text.  KF1's atmosphere was one of a kind. It's hard to explain, but the game made you feel like you were a British B-Movie action hero that was dropped into some sort of apocalyptic, survival-horror hellscape. KF2 just doesn't have that same feel which is a huge problem because that feel was what made Killing Floor so memorable and unique (aside from the great gunplay and balance). Where else can you rain lead on blokes with chainsaw arms in the ruins of England, all while heavy metal is playing in the background? Part of the problem are the maps. They just don't have the gritty texture work and lighting that filled you with dread like it did in KF1. The only maps I can think of that have even half of the atmosphere that KF1 had, are workshop KF1 ports and remakes like BioticsLabUK and KF1 West London. The fact that zeds don't talk anymore is also a huge letdown. Hearing zeds laugh and taunt you while they pick your team off was horrifying and contributed to that survival-horror feel. The charming character voicelines that made KF1 famous are also gone now. Even the music doesn't hit as hard as it did in the first game. -Balance  Every class in KF1 felt like it fufilled a role and had a purpose, but that's just not the case with KF1. On top of that some weapons like the Trenchgun feel a lot weaker than they should be.      TL;DR: KF2 ain't as great as the first, but I still loved it and it's worth a buy.",1,0
233250,Planetary Annihilation,"It is a playable game, but in its current state painfully mediocre. There is little variation between battles and the landscapes are plain and uninteresting.

Also they lied about the game being able to be played offline, you would think that they would be smart enough not to do that after Diablo 3 and Simcity.

392470,NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: Sphere of Influence,"I was a fan of Koei's Samurai Warriors series as well as Paradox games like Crusader Kings II and Europa Universalis IV, so I thought this looked worth trying out. And, boy was it!  Nobunaga's Ambition is a grand strategy game set in feudal Japan's 'warring states' period where Japan is divided into myriad little states ruled by various clans. In the game you choose one of the clans, and are responsible for internal development (building up your agriculture, building new city improvements, passing new government policies and so forth), diplomacy (building up strategic relationships with your neighbors, trying to schmooze up the Emperor, etc) and of course, leading your troops on a conquering spree across the Japanese plains, trying to unify the wartorn land. You can play as one of the more famous clans like the Oda or Takeda and have an easier time of things or you can try your hand at a tiny, one-province clan like the Shiba.  I would best describe Nobunaga's Ambition as a cross between Crusader Kings, a Total War game, and a JRPG. It has the conquest and dynasty building aspects of Crusader Kings and the real-time management of massive battles seen in a total war game. But unique to this game are cutscenes and quests, with the occassional melodrama worhy of a JRPG. These are great, and what really sets the game apart. I think Paradox would do well to have these little story moments in their games. And if you are a fan of Samurai Warriors, it is also awesome to see some familliar faces.  Overall, I highly, highly recommend the game. It is a bit expensive at the time of this writing, but I believe it is worth every cent. You will get hundreds of hours of enjoyment and an infinitely replayable game.",1,0

47810,Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition,"Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition   One of my favorite Role Playing Game of all time!  The game is close to perfection. Great setting, outstanding lore and backstory, good and funny characters, awesome soundtrack and the list goes on...  I had already played this game back in 2009, at the game release and I dared to get the Platinum Trophy on the PlayStation 3... and got about 250 hours into that game there. Yes, that game is THAT GOOD! On the PS3 version, the combat was somewhat generic, especially with a melee character. Now on PC, the game handles way better, has improved visuals compared to the console version.    PROS:  +Epic story. +Thrilling combat. (You can approach combat in any way you seek: Fast-paced, without pausing too much or going as tactically and strategically as possible... that latter option is mandatory for harder playthroughs though!). +Interaction with the companions. +Plenty of content (the vanilla game offers you many hours of playtime but with the Ultimate Edition, it adds a good 30 hours). +HIGHLY replayable (with many different type of characters and races, you get to have ELEVEN different Origin story). +Amazing soundtrack, voice acting. +Decisions matters and carry over the next Dragon Age games. You can still go on Dragon Age Keep, a beta system that enables you to craft DA:O and DA2 storylines and import into Dragon Age: Inquisition.   CONS:  -Dated visuals. At this game's release, the visuals were already average and now in 2014, it didn't aged well. -A few minor glitches that either requires a quick-reload or game restart. -Poor melee combat implementation.   RECOMMENDATION:  After logging close to 300 hours of playtime (PS3 + PC), I can honestly say that I really loved this game. I rarely replay games but DA:O was a good exception. Not only I wanted to replay this fantastic game but I also wanted to craft my storyline and import it towards Dragon Age 2.   So, to put it bluntly... Love RPG? What are you waiting? GET IT if you still haven't played it yet! Lots of replay value and many secrets to be unearthed and also, different possible endings!   DRAGON AGE ORIGINS RATING: 9.5 / 10   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  DOWNLOADABLE CONTENT:    A Tale of Orzammar:   Unvoiced storyline which serves as a prologue to the Dwarf Noble Origin. It was released as a bonus with the December 2009 edition of PC Gamer. It is a very short DLC (30-45 mins long) and doesn't add much and easily skippable.  RATING: 6.5 / 10    Awakening (Expansion):   Outstanding additionnal content. It either continues where the game ended with Origins and that you are still alive OR, it takes another Warden from the region of Orlais. New spells, skills, items, companions... You have a good 30 hours of content here on this very good expansion.  RATING: 9.0 / 10    Leliana's Song:  Prequel DLC about the origins of the Leliana companion character. It is a standalone adventure in which you play as Leliana during the mission. Adds about 2 hours of playtime.  RATING: 7.5 / 10    Return to Ostagar:  Short DLC that enables you to return at the starting point of DA:O. Also, if you had forgotten to recruit Dog, this DLC gives you a second chance to get it! You can also get great items and armour there! Highly recommended to play this DLC since you get to have good stuff soon in the game! This DLC adds about 1 to 2 hours of playtime.  RATING: 8.0 / 10    The Darkspawn Chronicles:  Short standalone 'alternate history' scenario that you play as a Darkspawn and 'what-if' your character has died in the Joining ceremony. Average-ish DLC but does give you some insight in the Darkspawn point of view. About 1 to 2 hours of playtime.  RATING: 6.0 / 10    The Golems of Amgarrak:  Special expedition to the Deep Roads as the Warden-Commander. This DLC requires your character to have Level 20 or start a new lvl 20 character. DLC adds about an hour or two of playtime.  RATING: 7.0 / 10    The Stone Prisonner:  Get to recruit Shale, the almighty Golem companion! Highly recommended DLC! This DLC is fairly long and adds about 3 hours of playtime.  RATING: 8.5 / 10    Warden's Keep:  This DLC grants players access to the fortress of Soldier's Peak. It also unlocks quests, new talents/spells and various items. Best pro of this DLC is the Party Storage Chest so you can store additional inventory. This DLC adds about 2 hours of gameplay.  RATING: 7.0 / 10    Witch Hunt:  Last DLC of DA:O. So what happened with Morrigan? You get an insight into what has transpired and maybe some closure between your warden and this Witch of the Wilds. This DLC adds about 1 to 3 hours of gameplay.

Since the killer is the host they experience no lag, whilst the survivors 'teleport' all over the map. At one point I was hiding behind a wall as the killer was getting close, then out of nowhere my location gets 'corrected' meaning I was moved no more than around 6-7 feet from them and in addition almost EVERY killer you go against will camp you until you die. Also if you want to play as the killer than you had better have another game on hand since I have to wait an average 40 MINUTES! I know this was just released but this should have been planned ahead.

Each playthrough feels unique, and as if you are having a conversation with the developers over character choices, level design, etc. Each boss fight feels like an argument, each secret location makes you feel like a famous Treasure Hunter.

6420,Nexus: The Jupiter Incident,"Great and intense space battles with cruisers, destroyers, fighter carriers and other heavy class battleships. Real time with pause -gameplay works ok and reminds me of old Interplay classic game  'Star Trek: Starfleet Command' .   During a battle, various weapons and resources play differing roles. Lasers and other beam weapons are used mainly for disabling enemy devices. Large missiles are slow and can be shot down with small fighters or FLAK-systems but have massive blast radius. Gatling guns, rail guns, plasma weapons and torpedoes are for hull destruction. Energy bombs are used for anti-shield purposes. Weapon power generators. Sensor arrays for detecting enemy equipment, ECM systems, ECCM systems!! And your battleship can hold few squadrons of small fighters, bombers, gunboats (or shuttles packed with space marine commando teams).  Visually game still looks very good after all of these years! The game difficulty can be pretty frustrating.. Even beginner difficulty level is really hard. Players who don’t manage their fleets very carefully are going to find themselves in pretty terrible situations, fast and brutal!    Some useful keyboard shortcuts (not explained in tutorial mode during first missions):  [ N ] - Yes! You actually can create custom NAV points! [ S ] - Select all fighters and other smaller craft. [ A ] - Select all large ships. [ CTRL ] + [ S ] - Select all fighters from selected large ship. [ M ] - Manual control panel on or off.

This works so well that it got me playing 3 days straight without even touching another game. Players unlock new factions by killing capital ship from the latter and there are plenty of mods extending existing factions or adding new ones.  The gameplay is simple, weapons can be bound to mouse buttons or auto-fire, every faction has its specialities and different blocks with different stats and forms, the game seems quite balanced at the moment, I played 6 factions to max and did not yet encounter problems with balancing.  Graphics are simplistic but beautiful, the soundtrack is hypnotic and does not get annoying and there is a lots of physics involved, the game may slow down a bit during heavy battles.  This game gets a whopping 9.5 out of 10 for making everything it wants right.",1,0

Ended up ditching Steel Series and buying Logitech gamepad only to end up with 360 button layout due to the games glitchy controller code.

248570,Toribash,"Ok... Toribash... How do I review this bloody game? Well how about a quote from the first time I played this thing? 'So... You press their bubbly muscles to move them and do super karate moves... Or in my case... Trip, fall, and die.' If that doesn't sound good, think of it as a massive karate battle where the main character does hyper karate stuff and then falls on his dumb face. Which is way more fun then it sounds. I think while this game isn't for everyone it is amazingly fun! For a smaller number of people then I wish. And you know what would make this game pure perfect? Steam workshop support. While there are a massive amount of modifiers in the game it would allow people to do things that aren't already in the game and allow us to have some character model stuff and maybe some ways to make it easier to do flippy kick-ey moves for the novices...

The environments are beautiful, the rocket boots are awesome, and there's plenty of secrets to find. The animations/voice acting can be a bit jenky at times and the models aren't that detailed, but that's the only issue I've had with the game. It's quite well produced for such a small team.  Buy if you like parkouring around giant environments, if you're looking for a long intricate plot-driven game this isn't it.",1,0

I than proceeded to spend the next 4-6 months playing through all possible endings and getting all the achievements (base game).  However I stopped shy of getting every achievement cause at that point I was exhausted and needed to do something else... but even after getting the sequels and trying out a plethora of other console RPG's nothing would quite get close to Dragon Age Origins.  So here I am... just recently bought this game again for the PC (while it was on sale mind you, but I had my finger on purchase for a while now)- and seeing and experiencing this game as it was meant to has given me a second wind.

11280,Penguins Arena: Sedna's World,"Penguins Arena Sedna's World is an extremely barebones king of the hill shooter. You play as a penguin throwing snowballs and other, slightly different colored penguins trying to push them off an iceberg and into the shark infested waters below. The maps are fairly varied with some being big arenas with lots of trees covering the edges making them long and sometimes frustrating to end and others being so tiny that a single explosion will throw half the players into the murky depths. Some of the maps even have collapsing glaciers that makes the play area smaller the longer the game drags on.  There is no health for the Penguins your only weapons are the slow firing snowball and your rather weak punch. Your 3rd weapon, which is both the best and the most risky, is yourself. By running and jumping you can pick up speed and by hitting other penguins transferring that speed into them sending them flying with incredible force. Of course, if you miss or get hit when moving that fast you'll often end up killing yourself. You can also pick up various power-ups on the map ranging for a brief invulnerability to snowballs to a small supply of rapid fire fish or an exploding fish that functions much as a grenade.  Graphically and musically the game is nothing impressive and there is no storyline, no voice-acting or really anything other than your basic deathmatch. The few different modes available only really allow you to change the number of teams in the match and whether or not your additional lives should run around as bots, fighting until you die and take them over, or simply be additional respawns that can't get themselves killed.  Although Penguins Arena is a fun little multi-player game it suffers from a number of rather major faults. The lack of any additional modes means that it gets repetitive within a couple of games and the lack of anyone else playing it online means it's only really fun when you can manage to gather a bunch of friends to play with, the bots available in single-player are simply not up to par.  All in all, not a game I'd recommend you get unless you plan to get it with a couple of friends so you have someone to play with and even then I doubt you will get through many matches before the repetitive nature of the game forces you to stop and go find a better alternative.",-1,1

243120,NA,"Betrayer is a nice investigative adventure game that has some horror aspects and some aspects that can be similar to that of Skyrim's open world. I didn't mind the whole black and white color scheme but you can choose to give it color if you like. This game doesn't have any side quests but you'll never get lost during the story thanks to the 'Listen' button you get that shows you pretty much where to go (I should note that you don't get this until the first town in the game so maybe not 'never' lost). Below are some pros and cons I found about the game.  Pros:  -For once I enjoyed not having to farm enemies for better weapons that might just be 5 damage more or something like that. All weapons of the same name have the same stats so you can focus more on the story and if you want, hunting pages and chests.  - Inventory space will never be a problem because you can 'scrap' your items in your inventory at anytime and gain money. Now that's convenient  -The gameplay for me was pretty smooth and incorporates drop when shooting arrows (not sure about guns because all I used was longbows.  -Collectables such as pages, key items and also treasure chests that are near will actually make a high pitches noise so that was helpful. Now only if my keys did that.  -There's also fast travel. Like, thank god. Seamless fast travel if you're moving around in the same map which is AWESOME.  Cons:  -Sometimes it will feel like there aren't really much enemies at all on the map.  -The shades sometimes hit you with a melee attack before they get in your melee range.  -Although it is listed as a horror game and I said it was, there wasn't really anything scary to me but this is just my personal opinion.  -After you beat the story, there's not really much replay value. Only to get achievements.  All in all, this was a great little indie game. However I don't think it's worth $20. I got in during the summer sale for like $5. If it was $5-$10 then go ahead and grab it!  P.s. Tomahawks are OP.",1,0

4000,Garry's Mod,"Spaghetti and Meatballs   INGREDIENTS  Sauce: 2 28-ounce cans whole peeled tomatoes in juice, drained, juice reserved, tomatoes finely chopped 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter 2 medium onions, peeled, halved through root end 1/2 teaspoon (or more) salt Meatballs: 1 cup fresh breadcrumbs made from crustless French or country-style bread 1/3 cup whole milk 8 ounces ground beef (15% fat) 8 ounces ground pork 1 cup finely ground (not grated) Parmesan cheese 1/3 cup finely chopped Italian parsley 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 large eggs 2 large garlic cloves, pressed 1 pound spaghetti Freshly grated Parmesan cheese (for serving) PREPARATION  For sauce:  Combine tomatoes with juice, butter, onions, and salt in large wide pot. Bring to simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat; simmer uncovered 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Discard onions. Using immersion blender, process sauce briefly to break up any large pieces of tomato (texture should be even but not completely smooth). Season sauce with more salt and freshly ground black pepper. Remove from heat.  For meatballs:  Combine breadcrumbs and milk in small bowl; stir until breadcrumbs are evenly moistened. Let stand 10 minutes.  Place beef and pork in large bowl and break up into small chunks. Add 1 cup ground Parmesan, parsley, salt, and pepper.  Whisk eggs to blend in small bowl; whisk in garlic. Add to meat mixture.  Using hands, squeeze milk from breadcrumbs, reserving milk. Add breadcrumbs to meat mixture. Using hands, quickly and gently mix meat mixture just until all ingredients are evenly combined (do not overmix). Chill mixture at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour.  Moisten hands with some of reserved milk from breadcrumbs, then roll meat mixture between palms into golf-ball-size balls, occasionally moistening hands with milk as needed and arranging meatballs in single layer in sauce in pot. Bring to simmer.  Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until meatballs are cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Cool slightly. Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and keep chilled. Rewarm before continuing.  Cook spaghetti in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain.  Using slotted spoon, transfer meatballs to platter. Add pasta to sauce in pot and toss to coat. Divide pasta among 6 plates. Top each serving with meatballs. Sprinkle meatballs with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and serve.   Oh the Game?  11/10",1,1

Then old lady starts looking around aimlessly. This goes on for maybe 30 seconds untill she keels over and dies.

Also, for all those that diss the multiplayer saying its bad because its a CoD or Halo clone ( which is not true ), I guess that makes CoD and Halo bad 3D shooters lol.",1,0
225080,Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons,"Brothers is beautiful in too many ways to count. The level design, the colorful, epic art direction, and the way the world lives and breathes through the many characters and creatures doing their own thing; the game is worthy of a buy simply for its environments. Brothers is a puzzle platformer with a unique control scheme: one character is controlled with each thumbstick of the Xbox 360 controller. While this can be a confusing way to control the two characters, and while it begs the question 'why did they design it this way?' The player soon comes to realize that the controls are part of the story itself, and that is when the game truly opens up into the indie masterpiece it is. Puzzles in this game are at times too easy to ever need to pause and think, and the game ends surprisingly soon, but the experience in between is priceless. The game does feature a bit of blood and gore, and a few violent and disturbing scenes, but even that is presented in a serious, understanding way that makes this an adventure for every audience 12 and up. There is nothing in this game that a younger player can't understand. Even the dialogue is complete gibberish, but for the gestures and tones the characters use allowing for anyone to feel empathy. Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is a masterpiece, and everyone should take the 4-6 hours to experience the whole thing.",1,0

323470,DRAGON BALL XENOVERSE,"Every game release has its up and downs, though that shouldn’t happen because of the technology we have. As for Dragon Ball Xenerverse, I would have to say the issues I’ve encounter so far were glitches, server crashes and single player crashes, and, of course, hackers. However, looking beside these flaws, the game overall is fun. You could definitely role-play your character with loads of costumes to choose from, although the costume stats could affect your created characters ability, depending on what role you take. There is a lot of Blast and Melee Supers as well as Ultimate’s to choose from. Sadly, Sayains are the only race that could transform, though Frieza and Namekians have the ability too as well. My rating for this game would be 8/10. 2 points taken off due to their limited hair styles and creation as well as other abilities that could have been implemented into the game – I’m not sure if they would add those in later DLC.",1,0

It also has a little feature that tells you how many 'steps' you did it in. I know a lot of people got this on sale, but honestly, it's WORTH the full price - I paid full price and I regret nothing! Also just a little thing I wanted to add - just because it's got illustrations of manga/anime everywhere you look in the community hub, don't feel like this program is only decent for drawing in that style, because I don't draw manga/anime (even though I wish I could!) and it still caters to all my needs!

So I am stuck on the first HO screen with an object I can't click on. Everything else worked fine, but when you can't go any further, since the game won't let you click on what it wants you to click on, is frustrating.   I got this game in the HO bundle, most were very fun and I enjoyed them. This title, if it wasn't in a bundle, I would not recommend this game. It is too buggy to play.",-1,0

221380,Age of Empires II (2013),"I grew up playing Age of Empires 2. The HD rerelease is the same game but with dozens of game braking bugs. The most glaring one for me being that the Huns racial bonus simply doesn't regester. When normally they start at max avilable population and don't need (and indeed can't even build) houses, my game now starts them at 5 population and makes houses available to build. So we can add non-existant game mechanics to the laundry list of issues presented for this game on the community support pages. Most disturbing of all is that this bug didn't develope until after I had played several games and now won't seem to go away.   Also, HD? Come on, the game still looks like a colored pencil sketch on graph paper. Don't get me wrong, I'll never hold that against it. AoE2 is a cornerstone of the RTS genre and I love it, but the fact that it's HD might be part of the issue. it seems more and more these HD rereleases come with glaring bugs and glitches not present in the origionals. Currently I can't even play this game, let alone recomend it, until these isues are fixed.",-1,0

48190,Assassin's Creed Brotherhood,"PROS:  + awesome and long story + good mix between historical settings and Animus UI + huge map of Rome (4 districts) + LOTS of side-quests + main assassination missions + Cristina side story + extra content in The Da Vinci Disappearance DLC + smooth combat with cool combos + big weapon selection   CONS:  - uPlay - really funky camera in some places - some annoying 100% requirements for missions - occassional graphical glitches - a couple of rare AI glitches - another cliffhanger ending   Comment:  We continue our adventure with Ezio. While AC2 felt like a huge step from AC1, in this case the changes are not that big. Ubisoft left the basics from what made AC2 great and added a whole bunch of extra stuff. This time it is just one city - Rome, that is divided into 4 districts. Still present is a really good storyline where Ezio is already established but builds up his brotherhood of assassins. The game is still fun and has lots of side missions to keep you occupied for hours. However, some types become a bit repetitive and the 100% requirements for many missions are just plain annoying. But I guess this is to counteract the fact that once you have you assassins that you can call upon the game goes into easy mode. So the only real challenge comes from the artificial requirements of the 100% completion system. The combat is the same as in AC2. Main assassinations are again great and fun, each playing out a bit differently to mix things up a bit. This time we see more of the Desmond timeline of which I am a fan. Some flaws are funky camera placement in some cases and sometimes weird AI. I would complain about uPlay but you all know what playing Ubisoft games is like. You simply need a uPlay account. Otherwise the game itself is awesome and while slightly worse than AC2 it still is worth your money. Recommended!",1,0

Such a beautiful game, with a beautiful scenario and a very rich world. But hey, forget everything and let’s make a grindy reskinned shadow of mordor game!   At the first glance, you will give this game a 10/10. But for me, a player that really loves lore and RPG elements, I can’t give more than a 5/10. I will give a positive vote because the game is really beautiful… but the simplistic grindy gameplay and the lack of deepness on the lore and the world killed it. I feel that this game would be a 10/10 if it had the same deepness of lore and focus on gameplay as other recently AAA had.

293440,Elliot Quest,"I can still remember the birthday I got Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. Being a huge fan of the original, I was so excited to dig into the sequel despite knowing nothing about it. For years it was one of my biggest NES disappointments, being too hard and too confusing for my elementary-aged self. I've learned to appreciate it in the intervening years, as well as similar games from the era like Simon's Quest and Journey to Olympus. I only bring this up because Elliot Quest has done an amazing job of refreshing all those memories, good and bad alike.  You play Elliot, a terminally ill youth on a quest to maybe save himself through divine intervention. There's a pretty rich and developed world to explore that contains four guardians that might have the key to saving Elliot's life, and it's your job to guide him through those forgotten places, and the cliffs and caves that lead to them, mostly unscathed. The world map is huge, with tons of locations of interest, side areas, secret areas, and even enemy encounters.  Elliot's default weapon is a bow that fires in an arc, but you gain experience from enemies that can be used to upgrade your attack (and movement and health and magic) that can make it fire faster or straighter. You'll also pick up magic spells, items like bombs and potions, and abilities like double jumps from the many locales you visit. Almost every single area has alternate paths and secrets accessible only with the right powers, so you'll have plenty of reasons to revisit parts of the world.  There are SO many paths and secrets, in fact, that it can often be hard to tell where you're supposed to go next. My main complaint about Elliot and his Quest is the difficulty, and it's a two-fold issue. The game dumps you in a wide-open world with a fairly clear path to the first temple, but after that there are tons of caves and forts and forests and cliffs that may or may not be the path ahead. You'll need to be very familiar with your abilities to know how to proceed, and many of them are creative enough to make that difficult. Your reward from the first major area, for example, is unlike most powers found in platformers and takes a good bit of experimentation to understand.  Even if you know where you're going, though, there's no guarantee you can get there alive. Elliot Quest can be very difficult at times, with a major spike around the second temple that came as a shock to me. Some enemies are posed in ways that make them almost impossible to avoid, and invincible enemies start appearing with more and more frequency the further in you get. Checkpoints are plentiful but you lose XP every time you die, a particularly brutal punishment considering how challenging some sequences can be. After a few hours my problem wasn't so much where to go, as my options being almost too difficult to face.  It's pretty remarkable how faithfully Elliot Quest follows in The Adventure of Link's footsteps, down to the confounding levels and difficulty spikes. They're both games that demand a lot of time and attention to appreciate, but are undeniably worth it in the end. Elliot Quest has an absurd amount of secrets and side content to uncover, all presented in charming pixel graphics and pleasing ambiance. If you like your retro platformers challenging and engrossing, you'll get all that and then some here.",1,0

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Hey, I think it is a good game and will recommend it. If you take into consideration that it was developed by a rather small game studio, it definitely deserves the recognition. For me it did not live entirely up to its hype, but that is more likely because I expected something a little different. For me it won't be one of those games that I get 101% into and play it all day untill I finish it, but I will get to the end eventually. I made a little list of my pros and cons as everyone seems to like making those (I do not want to stand out too much), so if you are not into that kind of thing, you can look away now.  Pros: - the story and story-tellling is good, and I mean really good. - fighting system makes me think about Dark Souls a bit, even though you do not get the invulnerability gap for dodge rolling (that is a +) - a lot to explore, tons of little quests and hidden optional things to find. - SEXY WITCHES TO EXPLORE (hue hue)! - story and music background. - minigames! lots and lots of them. - crafting and looting feels rewarding. - you do not get loads of money you will not be able to spend, you need to be carefull what you buy and where you save. - potion mania. Potions are rewarding and make big difference in the game. - mounted battles. - Boss fights make you feel like you accomplished something when you win them.  Cons: - controlls are not entirely right. It feels too much like you are just telling your character where to go, but you can only wish he will do it right. - I found a lot of messages asking for help with things like 'please help me find remedy for my children' and such, but I was not able to find said needy person to help them. Maybe it is because I am a witcher and I only do payed contracts, but I would like to be able to go out of my way and break the code for fun, or maybe I did not look hard enough. - the background looked cheap. And I do not mean the whole background of the game (like story, music etc..), because that was more than good. I am talking about the outdoors distant image that you look at when you do not run in the forrest. - I did not have a whole lot of a option when choosing 'my class'. RPGs should have more options as to how you choose to battle through the story, but in this it seemed very limited. You can say that witchers do not have much of a option when it comes to how they fight, but RPG games should have a solid variety of how you can build your character, making it feel like you are playing a different game for each build. - Not exactly unique. When you look at all the mechanics of the game, it is list of well made and well tried out features we have seen in a lot of different games put into one game. They did their homework and tried to pack everything people liked in different games into one game and did a good job on it. So this is probably just my feeling, but I would like to start seeing some completely new mechanics put into a game because I played fair share of my RPGs and feel bored of seeing the same.  All and all, I think the game does deserve the rewards it got, but only because year 2015 was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ year for gamers and new games. Otherwise we would likely see it in the top 5, but probably not the game of the year. Do not get me wrong, I enjoyed and still enjoy it, but I played better games.",1,0

However you can obtain prime items and sell them sell the trade chat for platinum and this is the only solution if you are not willing to pay real cash.  About the content, it always updated by devs, however as soon as you get all the new stuff then it might start to get boring and then you will have to wait couple days till something new arrives.

102500,Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™,"This is a really great game. Of my 16 hours playing this game, I have probably only done 2 of the main quests, because of the fact that there are so many fun side quests and side story lines to do. That includes the time I spent to beat the DLC, which I would say is worth the money spent on them.  The game allows you to chose your fate as you go. You earn skill points, which you can put into Might, Finesse, or Sorcery. After putting a certain amount of skill points into those skill trees, you unlock fate cards, which grant you bonus perks that will help you with the skills you unlocked in the Might, FInesse, or Sorcery skill tree. The best thing is that they have 6 fate cards for each skill tree, that you unlock as you put more skill points into your respective tree, but you don't have to only put your points into one tree. They also have 6 fate cards for each of the hybrid classes: Might/Finesse, Might/Sorcery, and Sorcery/Finesse.  For certain quests, you will also obtain Twists of Fate, which grant you permanent bonuses which could include extra XP, more health, more physical damage, etc. As you progress through the game, you get more of these, which all stack, so you become more and more powerful as you do quests.  The actual gameplay is great as well. It is a Hack 'n Slash sort of game where you can string together different combos that you unlock from the skill trees. It is also a Button Masher, but I like that about games, so no complaints from me.   The Story is interesting so far, but from what I said, I haven't played too much of the main story, just because of the sheer vastness of the side quests. I mentioned that I played the DLC, but there are so many other side quests and factions excluding the DLC. The game allows you to venture off as soon as you finish the tutorial area, and you are free to explore and do any side quests you want before playing the story.  The graphics are pretty good, but not amazing, and the voice syncing is kinda iffy, but the voice acting itself is really great.   The game is also somewhat easy to play, so I would suggest playing it on the hardest difficulty in order to have a decent challenge.  Overall, I would rate this game a 8.5/10, a must get for any RPG and Hack 'n Slash fan alike.",1,0

254700,Resident Evil 4,"Resident Evil 4 is a game full of character that I don't think many people have not heard of so I won't go over that. What I will go over are my issues. This version of Resident Evil 4 is... functional. Barely.  Riddled with bugs and having optimisation problems that it blatantly should not, this should not have been released in the state it was and even now it's barely better. Don't expect to run this happily on a computer from around the time Resident Evil 4 came out. In fact, even a sub-par system from a couple of years ago will struggle with this.   On the computer I wanted this to run I had to set the resolution down several levels, run the game without the fancy HD textures it comes with and even then the cutscene audio was out of synch because the game occasionally dropped a frame.  All that said this is still the best way to play the game out of the box, allowing mouse aiming out of the box and coming with official HD textures as well as the correct button prompts so you don't have to figure out what exactly 'Button 6' is during quicktime events.  Beyond that, I like it. The game functions, there are absolutely no control issues and the mouse movement feels amazing. With the graphics turned down the game will run on less than stellar computers although because of a lack of recoding the cutscenes can go out of synch but I put up with it.  Bottom line is that if you want Resident Evil 4, this is Resident Evil 4. Ported over carelessly, but a little less so than the last time. Buy this game on sale though, the myriad of technical issues devalue it far too much for full price.",1,0

It looks amazing in some ways, but the video quality suffers. I recommend at Least having something close to what I have if you want a playable experience. The main obvious sign this game suffers from poor optimization is in a scene where you walk into a room full of flowers and the frame rate for almost seemingly no reason drops to 25-35 fps, along with a really bizaare sort of mouse acceleration. The gameplay itself is really something,  I never played Dishonored the original, but I highly recommend Dishonored 2, *Despite the poor PC optimization* especially if it goes on sale in the next couple of months from release.",1,0

You can lead a group of bandits - looting villages, or a peaceful merchant, trading for profit, or a lord in service to a king, leading men (and women. You can even replace their dresses with war atire and wear the dress yourself - granting yourself the chest you've always coveted... if you're onto that kind of thing) to war. You can even found a nation of your own... Warband is definitely worth giving a go if you're interested in a medieveal game with action, strategy, role-playing and an element of politics and economics. Quite a gem, glad I stumbled across it.",1,0

32430,STAR WARS™: The Force Unleashed™ Ultimate Sith Edition,"I feel like this game is good, but it's missing a lot of things.  Pro's of the game: -It's Star Wars, and it's still The Force Unleashed, even if it differs from the other versions. -You get basically all of the extra outfits and DLC (Afterall, it is Ultimate Sith Edition) -It has a lot of fun features. You just run around, slice everyone up and use different force powers to unleash chaos. I feel like it can be challenging at times, but depending on what difficulty you choose, it's never unmanagable. -I imagine that most computers, even potato computers can run this on at least low settings.  Con's of the game: -Ported. The controls aren't very smooth, and using the force to throw people into eachother or do complex stuff is sort of hard. -Capped at 30FPS unless you use mods -No windowed mode. You can only play it in full screen -They took out a lot of the content from the other versions. For example, I don't think the levels with the Jedi Temple exist. Also, they either changed some of the levels or made them different. They replaced a lot of the enemies in the other versions as well. There aren't Navy Commandos, or medics, or really a whole ton of the same enemies from the PS2 version. Also, I might be wrong on this as well but it seems like there are less collectibles to find, such as the Lightsaber crystals. -Graphics aren't really extremely good, even on high settings with 'High Detail' mode on, but it was made a little while ago.  Overall, I'd say it's a fun game but don't buy it for the full price. I recieved this for free from a friend, and I wasn't dissapointed but it was a slightly different experience than what I remember on the PS2 version.  6/10",1,0

219150,Hotline Miami,"Short version: A fun, very brutal and sometimes challenging game with an awesome soundtrack. It's well worth picking up.   Gameplay: You control a hitman, but not the agent 47 type. This hitman goes in and brutally murders everyone in sight. No stealth whatsoever. Want to bang someone's head on the floor till it becomes a shapeless mass? Go ahead.  There is still tactics though because you die in one hit, so you'll either plan out you movements in advance or just jump into the action hoping for the best. By the way this game also has a quite intriguing storyline.  The visuals: It's pixel art so I guess you're either ok with the style or can't stand it.   The music: The music in this game is really awesome and fits the game style and atmosphere really well. The game would be worth it just for the music alone.   Final verdict: All in all Hotline Miami is a fun and sometimes challenging game that is well worth the selling price. Just bare in mind that under the pixel graphics lies lots of very brutal murder so it's not suited for everyone.   PS. Fun fact: The creators of this game found this game pirated on a certain torrent site. What did they do? They informed the torrent author that they are releasing a new version of the game soon so he should add that and that they don't mind the pirated version being available because they want as many people as possible to enjoy their games. Paying a few $ for their game is the least we can do to support such sincere developers.",1,0

98400,Hard Reset,"If you like FPS's (Dynamic/destructive scenery) with a little bit of thinking required, then this game is obscure gem, for anyone who likes comparisons, if you like(d) Bullet Storm, you'll like this! (Overall 8.625/10)  The graphics (8.5/10): Are very nice - nothing ultra amazing, but extremely well done, nice lighting, etc.  The sound (8.5/10): Is very clear (not too much goin on, all the time), in keeping with the theme and well thought out, directional sound is well positioned. Music offers nice dymanics, where required.  The general 'feel' of the aiming (9.5/10): Is about 'right' - There is a lttle bullet deviation and spread, but not so much that you cannot hit anything unless it is 2 foot from you.  The cut sceens (8/10): Are in a comic book style and the voice overs potray the emotion required, although (as with all titles of this style) are a bit hammy/cheesy, but I think this fits in with the overall theme of the game.  As this game does not spoon feed you the path and objectives with big arrows flashing above x, y or z. You do need to pay some attentiopn to what is actaully being asked and this encourages exploration and testing different destructive options with the scenery.  All in all, I am extremely pleased with this title and will endeavour to look for more by this software team - The latest remake/reboot of Shadow Warrior being the obvious next title to explore.",1,0

35450,Rising Storm/Red Orchestra 2 Multiplayer,"Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad is the sequel to the very successful Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45. RO2 takes you to the gruesome front lines of the Eastern Front during the assault on Stalingrad, the turning point for the German's invasion of the Soviet Union.    I was a veteran player of the original game and thus I will review the game as such. RO2 rides on the coat tails of its predecessor and tries to take it one step further. The step it takes, in my opinion, is a step back. RO has always been tactical shooter. There is no hiding behind cover waiting for your health to regenerate. If you picked a class, you may have options of what weapon you might want to take which depended on the timeline you were fighting in. The maps could be fairly small or insanely large (for its time). This wasn't a problem as there were copious amounts of vehicles you could drive.   RO2 takes some of those features then simplifies or cheapens others. For one, the maps are always linear and very small. Want to flank around the enemy from behind? Return to the battlefield or get shot. Want a Ppsh-41 with a drum mag? Better grind tons of kills to unlock a standard magazine. Want a standard issue bayonet? It'll be magically glued to your rifle after you kill the enemy X amount of times. It has a Call of Duty/Battlefield vibe which was counter to what RO was about. There is 'classic' mode which at least bypasses the unlock features but hardly anyone plays it. Also, due to the limited scope of the game being early in the war, your weapon set reflects that as well. The iconic MG-42, while records show was in the Battle for Stalingrad, doesn't appear in the game and yet a prototype StG 44 (MkB 42) is in.   As for vehicles, they have 2 tanks, one for each side. They've modelled the interior and crew which makes tanking a bit more immersive than RO. The problem with going that route, besides modelling the interior incorrectly, is it added much more complexity to adding more vehicles in game. This means after 2 years of being out, RO2 still only has 2 tanks. Just recently in the new patch, APCs were added (thanks to the community's hard work for doing so). Like mentioned before though, the maps are really small and thus APCs aren't needed for most of them. The community has since given up putting any more vehicles in due to the amount of work needed to do so.   Oh, and I forgot to mention, that regeneration behind cover? You have bandages now. As long as you aren't in a bleed out state you can essentially heal yourself. Haha.   IF you've never played RO1, you may like RO2. It receives a lot of rewards and praise (from people who never played the first one). It's more tactical than your mainstream AAA shooters and WW2 shooters are rare these days. It just could have been so much better.",-1,0

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"If you can get over the constant crashing issues and bugs, Fallout:New Vegas is a fun experience. Sure. the story might not be as interesting as in it's predecessor, but by God, does it feel good to blow someone's head clean off with a .50Cal rifle.  Good: The story is much longer than in FO3, and has multiple endings. The much needed 'true iron sights' is added. IF with all the DLC, the variety of weapons is just awesome. And the weapon modding in-game is a plus. The world is noticeable larger than in FO3, giving you more room to explore.  Neutral: The game has an active and great modding community.  Bad: The game has some stability issues, causing it to crash constantly. This is caused by the autosave feature being partially bugged, so a few mods should be installed to fix that. When you complete the game, that's it. You can't continue after finishing, unlike in FO3.  Overall, if you can get over the bugginess of the game, it's a fun experience, that I'd recommend for any RPG-loving person. 8.7/10",1,0

418340,RWBY: Grimm Eclipse,"I have to say, this game is fun. I read the negative reviews, and while they bring up a lot of good points, I have to say that this game is fun enough for me to overlook the flaws. Also, as a huge RWBY fan, it's very fulfilling.  Pros + The graphics are decent, and it captures the show's graphics well. + The controls are simple, at least on a 360 controller. I'm no 'beat 'em up' afficionado, so the fairly simple combos are good for me. That said, there's still enough variety that I have some choices. + The multiplayer is nicely integrated. Difficulty automatically scales with gaining/losing players, and there's both lobby's for friends and matchmaking. + It's RWBY. If you love RWBY, like me, this is very satisfying. + The characters feel different, and play a little bit differently, but aren't so different that you can't switch between them easily.  Cons - It is very grindy.  - The story is barebones, and very cliche.   So in summary, if you like RWBY, there's a good chance you'll want to get this game (especially when it's on sale). If you don't like RWBY, then you probably won't want this game. It's certainly not the worst game of the genre, but is probably not worth the money unless you're a real fan of the series.  As for the length, I've heard many complaints, but I honestly don't think the length is too bad. It takes a few hours to get through the campaign in total, but with 10 missions in very different locations, and a heavy emphasis on replay, it's not too bad, in my opinion. Future updates or DLC would be welcome, though.  Note: Edited after about 20 hours to reflect finishing the game.",1,0
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"Disclaimer: It doesn't run well at all for many people also why the game has been pull from the store  It runs okay if you install it on SSD, a few times I had frame drops and one time it was constant lower but I restarted the game and it wasn't there anymore and I have experienced a color bug with the back-menu (menu where your map/upgrades/bio/riddler-challenges is) which also was removed when I restarted the game. One big problem is it is 30 fps locked. I have experienced one crash.   The gameplay is fun and feels much more like Batman where you can make us of environment to take down enemies in melee combat and the advantage point isn't just gargoyles/gargoyle like things on the wall but various things.  The battle-mode with the batmobile is really fun. Pursuit mode can be annoying sometimes since you easily can get really behind the vehicle you are hunting down  Holding down left-trigger to start battle-mode and press 'x' (controller) to brake did take some time to get used to and so did the few changes to the control as well so it is lacking a proper turtorial and it lags more graphics settings most important is to get rit of the 30 fps limit.   There could be more challenge rooms (called AR challenges in this game), there was challenge room for every part of the campaign in the previous games but all of them in this are great, they could also have added rival points (points you get if you do better than the 3 stars) to the normal predator challenges.  Boss battles weren't as good as in the previous games, most of them are Batmobile related. More supervillains could have been intergrated to the main story like in the previous games instead of being pretty short side quests.   I appriciate that this is a trilogy (with a prequel) so the story ends and they therefor can go all-in with the tragegies and drama.   I would reconmend playing at least Batman Arkham City first to get used to the gameplay but the two others are also really good.",1,0

The design of this robot world is very stylized with its design and characters, the music reminds me of the classic Spyro the Dragon series as both of their music have a very other worldy quality. Gameplay wise it's a real challenge, the puzzle can sometimes be hard to get through that I ended up looking for a walkthrough to solve some of them lol But there are some fun little mini games here and there so it's not always that frustrating.

222640,Aarklash: Legacy,"Aarklash: Legacy has some appeal and the gameplay is solid. This game offers a unique way to battle. If you are a tactical player, I would recommend this to you. However, before you splurge your money on this, know that what this game is missing is substance.   Think of it this way: an empty cup. There’s no water, juice, coffee, etc. All Aarklash Legacy has to offer is gameplay. Aside from the gameplay, the story gets dull really fast. At first, the story may seem appealing, but after a while, the boredom and annoyance will sweep in. Bundled with an underwhelming character cast and voices, Aarklash Legacy makes its a stressful effort to continue playing.   Luckily, Aarklash Legacy is able to slightly redeemed itself with an innovative skill system. Each character has a choice between 4 skills and these skills gets more interesting around late game. Even though, it would be a challenge to continue playing that long, every choice made in the skills and how the characters are maneuvered in gameplay is crucial in succeeding in the battles. The story, voices, characters, and overall repetitious environment of Aarklash Legacy gets itself a big no.  Rating: 5.2/10 (52%) Achievements: 8/29 (28%) Game Done.",-1,1

274230,RONIN,"Cute and stylish Revenge simulator. Action-platformer with combat pause: you chose your next move, unpause, wild actions happens simultaneously ('turn based' tag could make you think that it has a separate turns for you and enemy, but it's not).  Main character has a skill-tree, accomplishment of three conditions per level (no alarm, kill guards, spare civilians) grants a skill point, to unlock stuff like holo-projector, sword throwing etc.  Visuals and sound creates feeling of meditative music video. Raining nights and revenge with a touch of melancholy and hopelessness. All that 'Old boy' stuff, you know.  Although, because of this meditative feeling, I'd recommend playing portions of no more than three levels (story arc) per session, for better digestion. And be careful it's not about pacifistic-shadow stealth, but about avenging by katana slicing. Big part of gameplay is a dancing under the crossfire. And under cyber-samurais strafing.  If you think about this game, just try demo already (it contains three full levels and full skill-set to try).",1,0

49520,Borderlands 2,"At low levels the game is playable solo, but as the difficulty increases I find that content is only available in multiplayer co-op. The leveling systems means that you will only be an effective partner if you are within 3 levels of the enemies. In other words, the population is divided in such a way that I often find nobody playing online in my level bracket.   As the game ages, expect to find no players available. The good news is that all content is available in the normal mode(the easiest version) so you aren't missing out on anything. Just remember that with the level dispersion that you may never find anyone to play with.   The storyline is well written just remember to play through the content at easy level and play in coop, if possible, when it gets hard.   I recommend this game when it's at reduced price from a sale, in the single digits range.",1,0

472770,HELP: THE GAME,"To be perfectly honest, I recommend this game (or bundle, rather) almost solely for it's charity value. The games within it are nothing special, as, from my experience, they're either poorly optimized or not too much fun. But, credit where credit is due, all the games were made in, what was it, a 72-hour span? So it makes sense. Some of the ideas are original, and my personal favorite game, NeverMine, was quite enjoyable, but (and this is kind of the same with most of the games, or something along these lines) it was stuck with motion blur always on, which not only killed the framerate but also made it kind of motion-sickening to play. So, all things considered, I absolutely recommend everyone buy this bundle, as it supports a worthy cause and the games are unique additions to your steam library, but don't go into these games expecting anything, well, game-changing. There's fun to be had, but not for very long.",1,0
224060,Deadpool,"Deadpool broke the 4th wall in the comics, but now it's time to break it in his own video game.  Deadpool is a game based on the Marvel anti hero of the same name. Deadpool is now in his own video game and he has to kill Mr. Sinister and he meets a few familiar faces along the way.  Deadpool is hack and slash game with guns. Not to mention the game breaks the 4th wall constantly and the game flow changes from a typical hack and slash into a platforming game and then into a top down 8 bit game. The gameplay is this games biggest weakness as it get's boring incredibly fast as nothing is really changed up during the fighting segments. Even the boss fights are the same as the regular enemies. The bosses only have a bigger health bar and that's pretty much it.  Deadpool's biggest strength is the amazing script and Nolan North's voice work as Deadpool. This game had me smiling and laughing the entire time and I loved every minute of it (I'm a big Deadpool fan btw). Deadpool fans will absolutely love the comedy in this game.  The cameos from different X-men are also awesome. Seeing faces like Wolverine and Rouge and Psylocke is just awesome and the comedy Deadpool spews about them is also incredibly awesome if you know the backstory and if you don't you get the option to hear about them in a recap narrated by Deadpool himself.  The game took me 5 hours to finish and apart from the one playthrough there is not much replay value as nothing really changes up. Not to mention there's no new game plus so you can't take the upgrades you got during the first time playing and import them in the second playthrough.  There are challenge maps, but those get incredibly boring incredibly fast so unless you plan on getting a 100% I don't recommend playing them.  Deadpool is also quite easy for the most part. There are some hard parts, but nothing incredibly difficult you won't be able to finish.  The game ran incredibly well. I got a stable 60 FPS and max settings and never had trouble, so I doubt people will run into trouble.  For the current price, I really can't recommend buying Deadpool as much as I love the character. The game while is fun and incredibly funny, it's way too short for 30 euros. If you can get it for a discount, I highly suggest giving it a chance. And if you love Deadpool this is a must own for the comedy itself. I enjoyed the game a lot and I would recommend buying it at a discount.  Final Rating: 7.5/10 - Worth Buying on a discount   If you liked this review please give it a thumbs up and if you disliked, post in the comments what you disliked about the review.

However the game is not without flaws. The game lack upgradability, which mean once you built something, there's not much left to it. If your eager is just to build everything on the build list, you'll have it all in few hours.  Thankfully, there's a large mod which added lots of craftable building to the list. The game, however still lack the quest/challenge to push you forward, even with the mod. In short, it's like Anno series in sandbox mode. If you're the type of person that lost interest once you reach the stable city build, play the game with the hardest mode. This way, you'll spend more time learning and perfecting your planning, instead of just spending 3-4 hour build everything the base game has on the list.",1,0

They actually seem to be on the cheaters' side, having stripped us of any and all power to deal with them (reporting does literally nothing, dedicated servers are gone so we can't kick them out ourselves, and to top it off, Friendly Fire isn't even an option in the game anymore so we're permanently stuck in kiddie mode!).  This is bad enough by itself...but then you add the horrendous 'game matching system' where you'll sometimes sit for 10 minutes just to find a game, even though there's 12,000 players online - skip this title.

241540,State of Decay,"The idea and gameplay is pretty good, unfortunately the execution in some areas is just terrible. The problem is the absolutely horrendous save system combined with the constant bugs can easily lead to frustration or game breaking scenarios.  This happened about 17 hours into the game with no survivor losses:  I was in the middle of a rescue mission which involves my survivor rescuing 2 other survivors: everything was going well, I decided to pause the game and do the laundry, came back in a few minutes and unpause the game. The 'Loading' screen comes up for a few seconds and I'm back at my base...turns out my survivor and the other 2 I was rescuing all ended up dead...while I was paused...was not even able to recover their stash since it didnt show up ont he map, or the area I was in, so I lost some of my best weapons in the process.  Basically at this point I'm done enjoying the game because at any moment I can randomly lose things I've worked for while the game is paused, the enjoyment is gone and now it's just a chore to grind through until the story is over.  I understand that a lot of 'random' events happen and the game continues to run when it's not being played, but to lose my character while the game is paused is absolutely ridiculous, especially since its permenant and unrecoverable. This was probably a bug rather than a mechanic but annoying none the less.  It's hard to believe that developers are still arrogant enough to think their games are flawless and implement a single-save, saving system, especially on a PC where manually backing up/recovering saves is easy to do ( which is something I constantly do now every time I pause the game), defeating the purpose of modifying/cheating through reloading saves.",-1,0

274170,Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number,"[This review contains absolutely nothing close to spoilers - I say this for the sake of people like me, who absolutely hate having the things they love spoiled to any degree]  This is the first time I have felt so strongly about a game that I've actually been motivated to really review it in depth. I've been wanting to since around the fourth chapter, but I stuck around to the end to make sure what I had to say still remained valid, or if I was going to be proven wrong somehow.  I wasn't.  First off, I am an enormous fan of the first game. I've put 40-50 hours in on PC, and have beaten it on PC, PS3 and Vita [with the hidden ending on all three]. I love playing random games of it here and there. I'm decent at it - not great, but can usually get Bs and above on most maps.  I was thrilled when I saw that Hotline Miami 2 was coming out, and while I didn't get a chance to play it launch day, I was eager to the next day. The first few chapters were fun... but then it became glaringly obvious that not only was the narrative style different in this game [which I didn't mind at all and still think is interesting now that I'm done], but the mechanics were as well. Gone is the system of accumulating masks as you go, opening up playstyle [and replay style, playing late-game masks on early maps] - instead, the game features a large cast of playable characters, each with their own unlocks [or not]. While some of these are interesting, I feel that the restrictions this puts on gameplay hamper more than enhance. While this system of multiple characters is necessary for how the plot is delivered, it forces the player into certain playstyles / decisions depending on the map / character.  The other major mechanical change comes in the layout of the maps, and that most of them are - as other reviews have stated - entirely too filled with windows, or enormous open rooms / hallways. The original did have some instances of this, but for the most part HM1's maps were tight, lower-visibility rooms / halls which meant you were more free to be stealthy and enemies were restricted in their vision. This is not the case here - all too often during your first play through, you're going to find yourself sniped by an enemy nearly the entire screen away, which was able to see you due to the layout of the map or line of sight through a window. Eventually I just got used to this, but it was extremely frustrating. HM1 had a few maps where you'd get shot through a window you didn't know was there [until this happened], but it seemed very, very frequent in HM2.  Along with the above, I felt like a few times some maps were geared towards a specific plan as being the only way to beat the map. Maps which start you with a certain character, and in a certain place, where it seemed that unless you do X, then Y, then Z, you'll get killed every time. This is unfortunate, given the first game's freedom to clear maps in different ways, depending on mask choice and random weapon drops. Hard to discuss this without spoiling maps, but again it felt like there were a few situations that felt like I had very limited options.  Most of the time, though, my strategy for beating any given map was this:  1. Find a room with as few windows as possible, run to it praying I don't get killed 2. Pop around door to bring enemies running, or shoot a gun to bring them running 3. Kill them as they came through doorway [maybe] 4. Repeat until this doesn't work, then go clean up the rest  Many, many times for me, a given map would have enormous piles of dead bodies clustered near doors, because it was the least-frustrating way to beat the map.  And then there are the glitches - and this game has a lot of glitches. The worst for me tended to be the doors - enemies passing through doors, about 50% of the time, became invincible. This made it very difficult to spring out from beside a door and hit a dog / human coming through the door, because most of the time they'd be invincible. I'd miss, then they'd end up killing me. The glitch regarding enemies spinning in place, or spinning in doorways has been mentioned frequently. I noticed another glitch, which for all I know might be intentional and not a glitch at all, but in one of the early chapters my aiming crosshair seemed to move erratically - it didn't circle around my player like normal, it seemed to circle random parts of the screen around my character, and he stayed focused on it wherever I moved him. Eventually this stopped though, and I never saw it after, which again makes me wonder if it was some intentional, but annoying, quirk.  This game is also ludicrously, unneccessarily hard. Hotline Miami 1 was pretty hard, but it's what I'd consider 'Demon's Souls' hard - when I'd die, I could tell it was because of something stupid that I did, and I'd learn from it and improve [even if it took a few dozen deaths]. HM1 was 'fun hard'. In Hotline Miami 2, the game throws poorly designed, overly-visible maps at you and armies of heavily armed enemies, and significantly restricts your methods of dealing with both, and that's why it's difficult - and throws the glitches in to make it even worse. It isn't 'Well darn, I ran out into the open without looking, that's on me!', it's 'I just got picked off by an enemy that I couldn't even see with my view extended as far as I could in his direction', 'I just swung my axe at that dog coming through that door, but apparently he was invincible, and just mauled me to death', and 'I'm stuck with a character that is entirely unsuited for dealing with this map, I wish I had someone else'.   I cannot for the life of me understand major sites saying this improves on Hotline Miami 1 in 'nearly every way'. It's a very different game mechanically, and I suppose some reviewers saw that as an improvement, whereas I see it as fixing something that wasn't broken.  I'm sitting here, and I'm staring at the buttons that indicate whether I can recommend this game or not, and I'm agonizing over it. When this game is good, it's actually pretty fun. I feel like there were a few maps that did bring back that fast paced but strategic feel of Hotline Miami 1. As others have said, the soundtrack is phenominal [it's not HM1's soundtrack, but it's very good]. The last fight was way, way better than HM1's was [and the level leading up to it is awesome]. However, when the game is bad, it is horrible. I nearly uninstalled it a few times, but I just had to know if the bad was temporary, or if it was just a running theme, and unfortunately it was a running theme. Far enough in, and I was just finishing the game because I'd already made it as far as I had - I mean sure I wanted to see where the story went also, but at some point it just became 'well it'll be over at some point, I might as well'. I somehow made it through without snapping my 360 controller in half, and I am proud of myself for that.   I don't even know what to recommend to fix this game, I feel like most of my problems can't be fixed without completely redoing most of the maps. I suppose as far as the character thing goes, it's kind of a necessity given how the plot is delivered.  Ultimately, I just can't recommend this. People who have never played Hotline Miami 1 are going to be frustrated at the insane difficulty and not be used to how it plays in general from playing HM1; people who have played HM1, like me, are going to be in for a very different experience than HM1, and an incredibly frustrating one at times, but not a terribly rewarding one after all is said and done. There's good in this game, but it's buried under the frustrating, buggy rest of the game. Get it if you adore HM1, though - your mileage may vary, taste is subjective, etc.",-1,1

301320,NoLimits 2 Roller Coaster Simulation,"NoLimits 2 is such a fun community to be a part of! Rollercoaster enthusiasts have been waiting a long time until a proper rollercoaster game. NoLimits actually uses the same software that real rollercoaster engineers use to create their screaming behemoths. How cool is that!?   That being said, the game does have a learning curve. It will take a while to master, buts it’s one of those games that’s well worth the time in trying to learn! Even though the game is billed as a rollercoaster simulator, you can even build whole theme parks! The easiest way being able to import your own .3ds models into the game. If you can't find any you like online or you are not good at creating them yourself, there are tutorials online in how to use the games supports system to create buildings and objects. Do not feel overwhelmed at first for there are tutorials all over to help get a handle on the program.   It may take some time to create an amazing coaster/park, but seeing these engineering marvels standing tall over your beautiful landscape is well worth it. I recommend any rollercoaster enthusiast to try the game out!",1,0

I've been a fan of 'Hempuli' for a while now and this game truly impresses me. Looking forward to more work from him. If you've been on the fence about this or would like an engaging metroidvainia experience, buy this RIGHT NOW. The music, world, enemies, story, and all other aspects of this game really do shine.

The marines campaign offers the standard FPS game, you are given a motion sensor which will aid you in tracking where enemies are coming from. The Predator plays a bit more stealthily, you can cloak yourself to be invisible to humans but can still be tracked by aliens. Also your infrared can show you locations of the marines but not the aliens. You can distort and distract the marines to allow for easier takedowns. The aliens has no ranged attacks but they have the ability to move about freely anywhere on the map. You can climb walls and ceiliings get places you wouldn't even think of.

50300,Spec Ops: The Line,"Introduction: The game takes place in an post post-apocalyptic Dubai, but what happens in the game's story rings true to every war that ever took place. Futhermore, I am sure that if a war veteran would play this game, it would be likely to trigger PTSD, due to the nature of imagery and feel that it gives.    Pros: -Really good, balanced and haunting story -Immersive environments -Choices matter  Cons: -Gameplay is slightly mundane -The multiplayer mode is just a filler   Conclusion: The game ends up being a great anti-war game that focuses on the atrocities that man is able to commit when pushed beyond limit, it's being held back a bit by the gameplay, which feels poorly ported. Nevertheless, I still highly recommend getting this game.   Rating: 9/10  Also, if you're looking for other war related quality material check out the following: 1) Joseph Conrad’s “Heart of Darkness' 2) Francis Ford Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now' 3) Terrence Malick's 'The thin red line' 4) Elem Klimov's 'Come and See' (this one's the harshest to watch) “The horror... the horror.” - Joseph Conrad’s “Heart of Darkness', also spoken by Kurtz in Apocalypse Now (1979)",1,0

I picked this game up as a combo sale with it's predesessor and I am truly glad I did. The graphics, puzzles, and design are great but it's the humor that knocks it out of the park for me. Good thing it's much longer than the first Portal and it weaves and interesting narrotive as a result. If you like puzzles, an interesting story, and a good laugh, don't hesitate to check this one out!",1,0
211820,Starbound,"Starbound is a really good sandbox game with a lot of tools and materials for building or exploring.   The progression system is fairly linear: you need X type of armor (or EPP) before going to planet Y if you want to be able to survive over there.   The story and side missions are a little bit too short and simple but that's probably because I did them after 'sanboxing' for 20-25h and already had some of the best gear in game.  Weapon variety is pretty good, some of the best weapons being received from quests, others as rare drops from mobs or bosses.  However, I think that the best aspect of the game is the building part, you have access to a ton of different blocks and you can pretty much build anywhere and anything you like. A night club? Sure. Underwater/underlava secret laboratory? Yep, it's gonna be pretty difficult but it can be done? Remote outpost on an asteroid field? Yep.",1,0

35140,Batman: Arkham Asylum GOTY Edition,"For a long time i have been putting off playing the Batman: Arkham games, idk why but I just have, so recently I decided that I wanted to finally sit down and play through them all, so obviously I saw it fit to play through the games as they were released.   Batman: Arkham Asylum, is a great game, though fairly linear. (it is techincally 'open world' but basically keeps you on the path of the story line, exploration is basically just to find riddler secrets) that being said the story is very interesting and will keep you hooked for your whole playthough, although it will not take very long at all to finish, just shy of 11 hours and thats including taking time to stealhfully take out the enemies one by one, and going off ocassionally to back track to a riddler secret that at the time I first noticed it I didn't have the right gadget to get it.   So the game is short but is for sure worth playing through!   With the game being almost 7 years old the graphics are very beautiful and the characters look detailed and wonderful. Note that this game does have an fps cap at 62 fps (I know strange, why not just 60?), so don't be expecting to get 200 and so on here, but that doesn't matter. the game plays smooth the whole way through and no problems with crashing or any of the sort!   So happy I got around to playing this game and know I understand all the hype surrounding this series!",1,0

49600,Beat Hazard,"A brilliant game: combining one of my favourite genres of the top down/side scrolly type shooters, with an element of customised content in the form of your own music, brilliant.   Your tunes are effectively your levels, thus the size of the game being the size of your music library, which if you are a music fan, no doubt will be forever expanding. In a way, you're making your own DLC when you download a new tune! On top of that, the ability to create and share your own ship designs, and the amazingly colourful and bright visualisation effects of your weapon fire makes for a truly amazing experience.  Currently having only played a few hours, about a quarter of my music library of 400 or so tunes. I plan to go through them all one by one, and then there's the option of going back again to beat your previous best and push your overall ranking on the leaderboards even higher.  A truly fantastic game, would definitely reccommend.",1,0
322500,SUPERHOT,"So I downloaded and played the leaked beta for this (I know, I wasn't there to back the game on Kickstarter, please don't sue me) and it looked ABSOLUTELY amazing. When I saw the full version was finally released, I was ecstatic. I bought it, waited 3 days for my borderline dial-up internet to download it and I was already impressed with the startup screen. I couldn't wait to dig into this. The first few levels were beautiful. I was finally getting the full SUPERHOT expereince. And then it just freezes. At first I thought it was just a feature of the game, maybe I had just hit a button and froze time or something. Nope. It crashed. I started it up again, got past another level, and it crashed. Tried it again, etc. etc., crash crash crash. A few hours of google searches gave me nothing other than the repetitive, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ advice the devs are giving out, 'Just make sure you have your antivirus disabled, make sure you have .NET 4, launch SH.exe, go ♥♥♥♥ yourself, etc.'. I don't want to give this a bad review for something that is potentially just me being a ♥♥♥♥ing moron, but it seems as though A LOT of other people have been having the same problem. And the devs don't seem to be willing to give as much as a 'Yes, we are aware of the problem, we will get to it soon.'   All in all, I WOULD reccomend this from what I have seen so far, but not until it gets some major bug fixes.",-1,1

115220,American Conquest - Fight Back,"A classic game that I used to play for hours on my childhood.  Nevertheless I will try to be as objective as possible.  Pro`s:  - New Factions - New Missions and campaigns - Huge variety of countries, tribes, units and building types. - Realistic economy (food is consumed constantly, coal and iron are needed for firing guns, gold is necessary for paying mercenaries, wood and stone for building and repairing wood and stone for buildings. Subsequently that means that:  1. No food: Your soldiers and ppl will starve to death 2. No coal and iron: European ships and units that use pistols and muskets can not fire!!!! 3. No gold: certain unit types (mostly mercenaries) will rebell attack any faction 4. No wood and stone: obviously you can`t build.   Cutting of the enemies supply of these materials can be a vital key to success.  - several historical campaigns - 7 player skirmish or multiplayer matches (It is possible to get a population between 2000-3000 persons per faction: 14.000 units in one match!!!1)  - Naval and land combat. - extensive training and tech trees per faction. - Buildings cannot be destroyed by simply hammering on it with a sword like in some other real time strategie games They must be destroyed with cannons or fire-arrows - Innovative city combat: it is possible to put units in any building. they will shoot (bullets or arrows) out of these buildings. Sending units into enemy buildings will get them fighting inside to take over the building. - damaged/burning buildings will slowly lose HP. - Moral system: Units are susceptible to fear. Especially if they get attacked from the rear or the flanlk. They will start running back to the base. - Formations increase moral, power etc.  - there are independent indian tribes which can be persuaded to join your side and deliver scouts and troops or trade with you.  Con's:  -City warfare: Innovative but does not work as good as it should. AI and other players use the del button to explode the buildings they are about to lose. Meaning that your soldiers inside die!!! Furthermore for every building you take the Ai builds another on the other side of the city. This can create an terrible drag and prolongs the fight unnecessary. On top of that in order to take over buildings the formations get dissolved automatically, causing the soldiers to flee quicker. - As the point above (City Warfare) is the final stage of every match, which can become very annoying, it dimishes the overall game experience.  - Population cap: It's cool to be able to have so many units. However the result is that it is nearly impossible to have a good overview of what is going on. Fleeing and fighting units run between each other turning the battlefield into chaos. A further problem is that it makes it possible to run over the enemy using numbers alone (except in the city), strategy is hardly needed or, considering the numbers, impossible to execute.  Conclusion:   American Conquest is a game that is worth experiencing for Strategy gamers that like the more traditional RTS games like AoE and EmEa. Despite the Con's it is an innovative, fun game.",1,0

To make it better, even when you get in game during normal cutscenes you have about a 1/2 chance of crashing and during a specific cutscene for me (the one where you leave Taris) I've only once got through it without crashing the game and am stuck since I can't continue on without crashing. I've probably started up and turned my computer off and on accurately about 35 times total, not even an exaggeration, just to get the game to work/start up.

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"pros and cons PROS-  1. open world  2. a wide variety of weapons  3. a magnificent story  4. post apocalyptic  5. not only is the story great, it has over 3 ways you can win the game, that sounds like nothing, but comparing this to COD or Battlefield, you feel like theres a million ways to win the game  6. over 8 diffrent societys, such as the brotherhood of steel, or the NCR or the enclave, or perhaps if you like melee and slavers, which isnt my strong point, try the great kahns or Caesars legion  Cons-  haha, honestly if you are that much of a idiot to read the cons, screw you, go buy the game,",1,0

203160,Tomb Raider,"Tomb Raider 2013. I have a mixed fealings about this game. Let us begin.  First the good stuff. The game and it's world is very beutiful. Enviroments, sound and just the feel of the world is done very very well. I spended maybe 10 hours after finishing the game just exploring this amazing world that CD created for us. For the most part combat system is well done. Dynamic cover is easy to use and I didn't scream at my screen 'why didn't you do what I told you to do?' that happens in many other games. If you die in this game, it's your own fault. Story, hmm, I will add it to the good side. It is one of a better stories in tomb raider game. I enjoyed it. A TIP - find all the documents on the island, because the people who lived here stories are acctually far more intresing than story of lara.   And now the bad stuff. QTE. Yep, I guess everyone is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of because just of how many QTE this game have. I don't know at that point of gaming somebody told 'you know that we need to do, make gamers press the same button repeatedly and if they don't, they just die and have to do the same thing over and over again until they get it right'. My god guys, this not NES, this is next gen, do we seriuosly need to bring back controlers with turbo button? KILL IT, KILL IT WITH FIRE. I know you guys wanted movie like experience, but I would much rather enjoy my beer while watching a cutscene than press the same god damn button 20 times. Ok I'm done about QTE's. Second, lara is a bullseye from daredevil comics. I mean my god 90 proc. of the time you get nothing but headshots with an bow and arrow. Not bad for a girl who never killed anyone until this point plus AI is not the best, play on hard at your first walkthrough, because normal difficulty is like super easy on other games. Third, I bought this game thinking it will be 'survival' game. You know, managing your goods, so you would have enough bullets and food. But nope, bullets everywhere and food... you have that one scene and that's it, as any other video game heroes lara don't need to eat for the rest of a game. Forth, puzles is a joke. And if you want to skip them, you can. Crystal dynamic was focused on making a movie, so they added few tombs just because the game is kinda have a word tomb in its name.  Overall it is beutiful game and a good game. But it's not tomb raider game. It feels more like 'tomb raider: the movie' than 'tomb raider: the game'. Way too many QTE's, way too many bullets laying around, way too many impossible escape moments. So you are guessing why I still recommend it after such a bad review. Because after finishing a game world opens up and it is just a joy to explore. I don't know why crystal dynamic did this. Why they pushes us foward and don't let just enjoy games world they created? At one campsite it says you will not be able to return and explore the game. But at that point the game is at it's peak point and if you are into the game, adrenalin will be rushing and you just say ' hell no I don't want to go back, I want to see what happens next'. And after finishing the game you are just done. You turn off the game and go back watching cute cats on youtube. I was done too. But then I read one comment that game is much more better after finishing it. So I got back just to test it. And it was 10 hours later, because I just loved exploring this world so much more than actually playing the game then I was pushed foward and just had no time admiring this amazing island. So this is my tip, finish the game and then go back to explore it, because you missed a lot, even if you tried to see everything, you just saw maybe a half of that this game have to offer. It is a shame really, that crystal dynamic couldn't find a golden middle between exploration and movie experience, because many people will miss out.",1,0

33930,Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead,"I've owned this game for some years now and I tend to go back to it now and then.   For me I really only bought this game for the Dayz Mod and kind of theft this game to rot in my library. I had never played the vanilla game and only used it to get to Dayz. However, when I did play it I couldn't get away from it. My 130 hours or so should explain that. Yes, most of that time I spent playing Takistan life with friends granted but other game modes were very interesting to say the least.   I never played the main campaign and don't tend to either, I believe this game is best when playing multiplayer; but only when you are with friends. Playing this game without a friend or two gets boring after a while, you can try and make new friends but if you're like me that isn't going to happen.   Does anyone else love the glitches on this game ? I do, especially the ones on the Dayz mod where planes would bounce on the ground and you would die because of it, or when you try to vault into a blown up building only to break your leg. Loved it. The Dysnc! Oh god, if you want to be in the passenger seat and watch as the driver crashes into every tree in the game then this is the game for you to realise that it didn't actually happen?   I like this game and always will do, but due to the lack of friends to play with and the fact I can't get the Dayz mod to work this game is some what dead to me now and will forever be a memory of the good times I had, an their were some good ones.   6.5/10. Why ? Because like I said before, its only fun when you're playing with friends and it gets quite repetitive after a while and very boring and stale fast, and to many it is only a way to get to the Dayz mod which now for me is dead. Maybe if you were buying this is 2011-2013 then it would be great fun.",1,1
551690,Counter Fight,"Here is my firstime gameplay video:  https://youtu.be/aJ7_NxUzn3U   I also review other VR games on my channel:  www.youtube.com/c/thefishstick   I freakin loved this game. I had no idea what to expect but it looked a lot like job simulator which I really enjoyed. So much Japense spirit in this game; I loved the little cheerleader on to the side. She did a great job keeping my spirits up, motivating by shouting to me what I assume were encouraging words in Japanese. She always was nice to throw objects at without consquences. The music really got me dancing :D There were a couple of bugs when I went to give the bowl of noms to the customer and it randomly flew off the table but aside from that the game ran fantasic! Matches the price perfectly!",1,1
257850,Hyper Light Drifter,"What can you really say? Just watch one trailer and you'll immediately recognize how uniquely gorgeous the graphics are. Seriously, the visuals elicit an almost physical response -- they're that good! Couple the fantastic art with an ambient electronic soundtrack that nails the mood down perfectly, swelling from haunting atmospherics to empowering battle music, each complementing both the exploration and the brutally difficult (but totally fair), lightning fast combat respectively.  The grand feeling of solitude this adventure evokes is both haunting and empowering. As your character progresses, earning purchasable upgrades through hard won collectables (either through combat or exploration), you really get a sense of newfound power with each new ability. And you will need them, because pretty much every enemy in the game can be deadly if not kept a keen eye on -- especially if they ambush you en masse.  The story is told simply and unobtrusively, through exploration and pictorial 'conversations' that allow you to infer what this world is about rather than being beat over the head with endless text boxes or overwrought cutscenes. Some may yearn for a more conventional, straightforward narrative, but I for one prefer this kind of understated, but actually very effective approach.  This game just exudes quality and attention to detail. It's a lovingly crafted world that's both a joy to behold, and a real struggle to survive within; both the feeling of discovery and the sense of danger are expertly balanced and impeccably paced. I cannot recommend this title enough.",1,0

But that's the only good part, really.   The game is terrible about providing the player with goals, direction, or meaningful ways to make progress. Rewards and punishments feel totally random. Learning to survive in the game is pointlessly harsh because of the poor communication; you'll probably need a wiki just to get started.

I tend to enjoy the AFK aspect of this game and it almost feel like I'm playing a multiplayer game or some kind of MMORPG.   The only thing I DONT like about this game is playing it knowing the earth is really flat :( If you do some research.. you'll find out that NASA has lied to you your whole life. Gravity is not an actual proven + testable theory. Sure something pulls us downward.. but thats all... There may be no inhabitable planets.. the moon + sun are simply not what we're told they are. Every picture from Nasa is CGI.. Go look up Rob Skiba , Eric Dubai , Matt (or Math) Powerland.. There have been numerous attempts to measure the curve of the earth (if it was a ball) and there is no curve. The simple fact that you can see an object in the distance (with zoom Lenses like px900's) that should be below the actual horizon is enough proof for anyone. The rest is nasa and how much they put out is CGI .. then go look at the history of Geocentrism + Heleocentrism.. Your mind will be blown.. The edge? Antarctica.. Don't believe me .. and dont just watch 2 or 3 videos.. I've seen people researching this for 50 years.. it's flat.. we're very lied to. Its pretty sad.",1,1

Plus, The Path has the perfect balance of normalcy and weirdness that keeps you entertained. It kept me entertained, at least.

BE CAREFUL!!!! READ system requirements.  bought the game 3 days after christmas... Direct X11 ***ONLY***, first time i hear about directx uncompatible games...   STEAM: thank you for the japanese language notice, very helpful (sarcastic)  i check ram pcu and video card requirements, never tought of checking my direct x version, my pc runs all crysis on max but i cant play this game!!!  dont download it before checking your system, its a 37gb download, for nothing in my case.  my 2gb gtx 260 is obselete, my alienware m11x laptop is obselete. not just a bit sluggish, we are talking COMLETELY uncompatible here. i gotta spend 160$ for another 2gb video card to play the game... and throw away a perfectly good card, a perfectly good 2gb card that plays all my other games... bummer.  Thank god i bought ithe game on sale, but its a major problem.  p.s. all you people who have dx11 seem easy to blame us for not being up to date with our hardware, but i dont want to change my laptop, and my tower has a 2gb card that is simply not compatible, you can claim dx10 is obselete and we should read specs and we should upgrade etc etc, but its easy to say if you already have the damned compatible hardware. basically this game made me learn my current card is obselete now, i learned the hard way. the expensive and loooooong way cuz my connection aint that great. i wish this comment would have been on the first page i read where everybody gave the game amazing results. i waited two days for the thing to complete and i cant even play it.  i bet its great, but its ultimately unplayable for me before i can cough up another 200$ for something compatible that will run the game smoothly, ask me to give it 10/10, how much points does a game loose for being a videocard killer???  i give it a good fat 1/10 untill i can play it, then we will see how many points i make it loose for making me spend 200$ more than i expected.",-1,0

501840,Don't Disturb,"( Before I start, I would like to give a seizure warning, it does have two instances of flashing that comes unsuspected, lasting a few seconds ) I bought Don't Disturb mostly based on the art and seeing the premise sealed the deal. In Don't Disturb, you explore traditional Asian views on the afterlife through the eyes of a dog searching for his/her owner. Accomponying you on your journey is a bird (I'm not sure if it has a specific name, but I have found birds are often seen as guides in the afterlife, The Flight of The Soul) acting to give you various scattered information.   Pros:    Art  The strongest aspect of the game is the artwork. It gives the game its own personality, with a style looking like it was drawn on paper. Many characters are also visually interesting.    The story (or the feels)  As the game does repeat the song (unless I didn't realize other songs) but as you continue your journey, you do stumble upon heart warming situations. The game does have two different endings, which can shape the whole journey (and the meaning of it), but they do not lack having a heart warming ending for both choices (I recommend seeing both endings).  Sadly, there are various cons with Don't Disturb:    The bugs/glitches  These bugs/glitces require you to exit out of the game to get rid of them, but there is a chance another will arise. The bugs/glitches I came across was not being able to interact with the entities needed to continue, froze in the spot after talking to a entity needed to continue, and images of a puzzle disappearing while a dialgue box is being activated.    The menu is always dangling on screen, and clashes with the art in the game    The English translation can be better, there are a few awkward wordings (along with this, the dialogue can be on screen longer)    The lack of Steam overlay (if you want to take screenshots, you will not be able to)   All in all, I do recommend this game, despite the bugs/glitches. If you have no patience with dealing with bugs/glitches, wait till they are fixed till you play it as it is a unique experience.",1,0

This will not be a challenge to most people. That being said, the narrative is fantastic. Although a relatively short game (5-8 hours) the quality of the plot is worth the $15 price tag.  Additional: Before going into this game, I knew very little about World War I, the game expects that. Valiant Hearts is built in a semi-educational way and has direct links to Wiki pages about the real historical events. Furthermore, the levels and collectables within the game have facts that are interesting to read. This is a great mechanic for encouraging natural learning. I kid you not, I spent more time outside of the game pondering and looking up facts about Vauquois and Ypres (and other events/items) then I did playing the game. My 8 hours of game play (as of today) does not reflect the true time I spent with this game. If you are vaguely curious about the Great War, start here. If you aren't, still play the game.

80310,Gemini Rue,"Started this a long time ago and left it alone for some time. Picked it up today and couldn't put it down. One of the best cyberpunky point and clicks games I have played since Blade Runner..of which it lends a lot of its dystopean world from but with great effect. Sinister plot and pretty good voice acting, pick this up if you want an immersive story that will last a few hours. Graphics are old skool 8bit but it works for the style they go for, voice dialogues have a portrait present when characters are speaking. Puzzles are pretty easy if you pay attention to the dialogue and stay on track, otherwise future tech and machines won't have a context.

394360,Hearts of Iron IV,"Ok, right to the point, after three major patches and one buyable DLC, Hearts of Iron IV still feels like a bit of a mess. While they claimed to go to war against micromanagement, I would argue that with all the AI options in HoI III you can use to reduce it, IV actually has way more micromanagement than the previous title. This is one of my major complaints.   A Short list of my personal grievances: - Production and stockpile system, while it feels like an improvement, does add a lot of micromanagement. It also cannot be AI controlled, so you have to take care of it manually.  - Trade is actually a bit more complicated because there is no money in the game. You actually pay for resources with civilian production. Cannot be AI controlled and thus can add micromanagement.  - Air battles are region based. While this in itself could be fine, it's not fine that some regions are way to big for most of your early planes, which means you will receive a penalty due to not being able to cover the whole region. Oh, and yes, cannot be controlled by AI.. so a hell of a lot more micromanagement (unless you preferred to do this by hand in HoI III) .   Things I think are improvement over the old one:  - The Unit AI is actually great for both player and AI. Sure, it could always be better, but it's certainly a huge improvement over the last one. You still will get most likely better results by micromanaging your fronts by yourself, but it's not that bad. - Naval system is region based, just like Air system. WIth navies the new system actually works well since they are not that range limited. Also it is definitely an improvement, as I think that it was one of the weakest points in previous game.  - Research system is closer to HoI II, which I think is overall a better system. No more 'Small Arms 10' research, every item is a single research which feels a lot better. Each nation has varying number of reasearch slots and the tech trees seem to be balanced towards multiplayer game, so differencens between nations are cosmetic at best. Tanks are exactly the same, even if their names might differ from nation to nation.  - Workshop mod support. This is absolutely fantastic feature, and there already are many great mods out there.  All in all, I would say that HoI 4 still has the potential to become the best game in the series, but right now it is up to future patches and DLC's to make the necessary changes. I recommend this game solely on this basis, and because there is no 'neutral' vote. :)",1,0

4720,Condemned: Criminal Origins,"...Great game...1st game I ever played on the 360 in 2006. Just as good today. But here are the few frustrating game quirks you will have to deal with... The block mechanic, no matter how hard to try to master &amp; analyse it...it will so often be your undoing, it will be your demise so often..it is a severe problem, I learned to play without it in the end...attack then back-peddle worked much better. Sprint/run can also not be trusted...it feels like and acts like there is glue on the souls of your shoes...very odd. Next, once in a while when the AI &amp; I were using the same weapon type, my melee reach was about a 1/2 or a 1/3 of their impact range. I really noticed this is the 'Orchard' level where we all used flaming torches as melee weapons. I had to get within about 4ft for a hit to register but they could hit me between 10-12ft away...that seemed very cheap &amp; a real cheat by the game mechanics. Finally, you will always slow down to a crawl on stairs &amp; you will often stick on the most minor of steps...odd as steps/stairs will not slow the AI...  Other than those oddities it's well worth a play thru...a short game which took me 5hrs in total to complete....so in the end recommended :-)",1,0

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"This game got a very bad rep when it first came out because of all of the issues with running the game. There are still some issues (I drop to 30 fps rather often sadly), but now that this game is playable at least, it deserves to get rid of it's bad reputation.  Batman: Arkham Knight is, in my opinion, the best Arkham game in the series. What really sold me with this installment of the Arkham series is the story. Granted, all of the other Arkham games have good stories, but I have never been so sucked into the story of a video game until I played Arkham Knight. All of the mechanics in Arkham Knight work much better than in any of the other Arkham games, so this one plays much nicer. The free roam is also so much more expansive, and there are a lot more side missions than the other Arkham games. This game certainly has the most play time out of any of the Arkham games. If you are okay with dealing with sometimes wonky frame rates, then I would highly suggest getting this game. If you are not okay with that though, then maybe this game isn't for you.",1,0

The colouring and character designs are superb and the music sounds like something that would never be expected in an indie title, it's just that good. The bosses in the game are intelligent to a degree(It's still modern AI), so just running in and slashing like an idiot is not rewarded at all. Which is what a game like this should do.",1,0
231430,Company of Heroes 2,"This game is in no way bad but it deserves this bad review for disrespecting its customers and here's how:  1- The game cost 30$, to unlock the other 'factions' you need to pay another 30$, if you don't do so you'll end up playing as the germans or the soviets and nothing else, with a very small amount of generals and maps which becomes boring very quickly. 2- You have to pay 25$ to unlock DLCs, now these DLCs aren't anything special, they're just campaigns... So far we payed 85$ to get a decent game with campaigns in it lol... Right now they're selling 1 and 2 for 60$ but these new 'factions' and DLCs never existed when old players like me bought this game for 60$... The devs disrepsected their old customers by selling them Updates. 3- Just like I said, there's a very small amount of generals per 'faction', about 3 of them, which is absolutely nothing! And that's why they started adding more generals and now there's about 15 per faction but each general costs 3-5$...  My Point: ---------- People like me who bought this game when it was released had to pay about 150$ to enjoy it because they started to add DLCs and Factions but we had to pay to get them which is just a pathetic move by Relic because all of these should've been Updates to the game, for free.  For new Customers: --------------------- If you want to enjoy every aspect of this game you need to pay about 90$ to get it with all its factions and DLCs, about 10 new generals and no skins at all.  In Conclusion: --------------- 1- They disrespected their old customers and didn't give f*ck, they'll do it again. 2- Don't be fooled by the price of the main game because, again, you have to pay an extra 60$(minimum) to enjoy all of its aspects.",-1,1

210970,The Witness,"Both a very good puzzle game and a beautiful world, a very nice,   artsy   and atmospheric walking simulator+puzzle game.  Firstly, let me point out 2 major flaws, this game might come off as deaf friendly and colour-blind friendly, but it is not.  A very large amount of the puzzles are colour based, and the game does not have a colour-blind mode.  1 Section of the game requires your ears, but to be honest you can just look up a tutorial for those puzzles, only a very small percentage of the puzzles require your ears. So it shouldn't be that big of a problem.    Now, let me get into the game, firstly, the quality of the actual puzzles.  They are great. They are just the right amount of challenging and they keep you engaged, and at least for me personally they didn't bore me. But, if you pay no attention and just try to blast through it you will most likely have troubles, you are in some way or another told subtly how all the different puzzles wok, but if you do not pay attention to those tips you will be clueless. When you solve the more harder puzzles you get a good feeling, you feel smart, and rightfully so.  The art style, the actual world is beautiful. If you enjoy looking at games like these for the art, the scenery and the atmospheric vibe, that might be the big selling point for you, forget the puzzles, get your screenshot button ready.  If you're going to 100% this game without looking up guides you will net maybe 40-50 hours, and you will enjoy every second of it, when you're blasting through puzzles in one area you feel great and you're having fun, when you're stuck on a puzzle, learn to not be angry, learn to sit back and reflect on the scenery of the world while you try to figure it out. The game is extremely good.   9/10, a must buy for any puzzle fanatic or walking simulator fanatic.  But, let me say again, I am extremely disappointed that there is no colour blind mode for this game, that is absolutely ridiculous.",1,0

209160,Call of Duty: Ghosts,"I have really enjoyed Call of Duty since 3 came out (played 2 after I played 3 and enjoyed it too), with the exception of World at War and now Ghosts. So I am not going to come out and say that it's the same game every year, as if that is even true. Different guns, different killstreaks, different maps, I'd even go as far to say a whole different playstyle needs to be adapted. It changes enough year to year. That being said, this game is a huge letdown. The campaign was probably the biggest leap they made, which is sad because as everyone knows, CoD is a multiplayer game first. They introduced new campaign elements that atleast kept me entertained for the 5 hours it takes to get through. By no means is it a stellar story, but it is an improvement over previous Call of Duty campaigns.  Multiplayer is unplayable. Literally. You cannot find a game on PC. I've played this on Xbox 360 and PS4 and find matches pretty easily but it appears that the PC audience is absent from this installment. If you are looking for a fun FPS to play on Steam with your friends, I would advise you to look elsewhere. There are a total of maybe 1,000 players online during peak hours, and of those players more than half play Team Deathmatch. If you want any variety of gameplay like an objective, you can go to hell. Aside from all of that, the class customization is over the top. In CoD4 (arguably the best of the series), you get a Primary, a Secondary, 3 perks, a lethal and tactical grenade, and that was it. Short and sweet. In Ghosts, Jesus ♥♥♥♥ing Christ. A primary, a seconday, two attachment slots for each, camo for each, lethals, tacticals, 17 ♥♥♥♥♥ons of perks, 90 different killstreaks to choose from. What's next, can I choose the camo on my ♥♥♥♥ing frag grenades? It's overwhelming, it's not fun. I feel like to compete in this game you have to sit and heavily think about your loadout and it is supposed to be a casual shooter game. They took the appeal of the simplistic shooter style of CoD4 and said ♥♥♥♥ it, you wanted a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as a snack? Here's a 5-course meal prepared by the Emperor's gourmet. It's overkill.  Squads mode isn't even worth touching. Why the hell is this in the game? Just do a Basic Training mode like Black Ops and be done with it. I don't wanna pit this pathetic AI system against itself. I guess I can't bash it too much since that is what I had to play most of the time, since I cannot find a damn multiplayer match to jump into.  Extinction. We get it, you want to re-create a fun game mode like Nazi Zombies. Try again, I guess. I can't hate on them for trying to do something new and fun like this but it was poorly executed. Maybe it's different now, I only played the first 'episode' of it on the PS4.   Activision, get your ♥♥♥♥ together. Stop dishing out money on stupid ♥♥♥♥ing live action advertisements with big name actors, start using the money to make more quality games.

The boss fight in particular are terrible, a bunch of mini-bosses have no diversity, you dodge their attacks and can repeatedly use the same abilities to defeat each of them.

The indie game is a little long in the tooth now, but at release it was heralded as one of the new greats of the indie era.  Beautiful artwork, wonderful music, well-told narrative to an interesting story, with a wealth of weapons to choose from, along with power-ups, power-downs, and barrel rolls combine to form a true gem.

245150,The Novelist,"On the whole, a pretty enjoyable and well polished title for the fans of story-based, exploratory and choose-your-own-adventure type games. Not sure if i'd pick it at full price but it's a good deal while on sale.  Things I Liked: * Dans struggles REALLY resonated with me, reminding me of periods working on my first indie game, and now the second * I found myself sometimes choosing one person's resolution even if I rooted for another character, because I thought this path would actually help them more  On the downside: * The gameplay gets a bit repetitive quickly, looking for the same clues in similar places in the same house over and over and over. Tho I can see how that is subliminally part of the message. * While I enjoyed the ride and occasional unexpected twists, I felt most of the outcomes were very predictable, and pretty much knew where things were going before I even made the choices. A somewhat archetypal themes. Would've enjoyed a bit more unexpected results.",1,0

8930,Sid Meier's Civilization V,"Civ V is the pinnacle of the Civ series - everything before a buildup to this, everything after is just a shadow of it. It's an incredibly addictive and fun game, and even if, at later stages of the game, most of your play time is reduced to just waiting, time still flies. I would absolutely recommend this game.  That said, there are several minor gripes I have with it:  - turns late in the game last up to 30 minutes of waiting for AI to finish. Good for catching up with reading or doing some work on another monitor if you have such an opportunity, but not for much else - sometimes, internet games get randomly disconnected - when internet games get randomly disconnected, the AI *immediately* takes over for the disconnected player and spends all his remaining moves. If the host then saves, reloads, and re-invites the disconnected people back into the game, their turns have been wasted. - re-inviting disconnected people most often doesn't work if game is already in progress. The host will usually have to reload the game. - no support of inviting steam players over LAN - AI is given cheats on higher difficulty, rather than a better strategy. As such, penalties for unhappiness or lack of gold do not apply to them, and their units *never* get disbanded if they run out of cash. That's just no fun.  And then there's my wishful thinking:  - it'd be nice if the AI and a player's interaction with it was in any way customizable / replaceable. I would love to write a new AI brain and plug it into the game. I'd add 'Make it up to me' options to the dialog when you catch the AI spying on you, I'd add respect and geographical modifiers to an AI's decision to attack you, I'd add persuasion stats and perks to leaders and dialog trees similar to those in Mass Effect or Deus Ex: HR, leading to the optimal outcome in negotiations, and more. - it'd be nice if there was a way to remove the barbarian AI from the game after a while - in later stages of the game, the barbarian AI thinks for up to 5 minutes even though it has no camps or units remaining, or even empty tiles on which to spawn. - I'd love to be able to select which tiles to focus expansion on in the city view - previous Civs supported this I think  Anyway... definitely get this. It leaves a lot to be desired, but it offers so much you'll forget about the downsides.",1,0

If you can grab the game for few cents and you don't care about getting all achievements done go for it. Otherwise skip this one. It's a quality worth a dozens other free online flash games. Trying to get to 3 stars is purely lucked based in last levels, you can do everything correctly, but still anything of the following can happen: you get stuck behing an invisible obstactle that shouldn't really be there / soldiers decide to shoot your zombie first even though literally every other zombie's closer to them, which end the level for you / soldiers decide to finish the zombie they started shooting even though other zombies are closer, killing you zombies and not granting you that 3rd star. The fact that soldier's shooting and your bitting are animated with same time frame is annoying as hell as no matter that you stepped on the soldier in between his shots, you're still bitting the same speed and moment when he's shooting, which leads to so much moments of you dying the same moment soldier got changed it's beyond depresive.",-1,1

8870,BioShock Infinite,"Note: This review is for Burial at Sea, primarily episode two in particular. It also contains some spoilers in the story section.  Gameplay-wise, Burial at Sea is fairly fun, with the more stealthy Episode 2 being a nice change from the standard formula. The game seems to heavily encourage stealth, but it's quite possible to slaughter everyone you meet with few problems, you just have to be a bit more cautious and pick enemies off one at a time. Personally, I found it immensely satisfying every time I cleared a room with lethal force, since it was kind of a mix of the best parts of combat and puzzles combined into one. Sadly, the lack of quick-save meant that if you messed a section up, you had to restart from relatively poorly placed checkpoints if you wanted a fresh run at a particular room. One very notable section had a checkpoint followed by a minute and a half-ish section of dialogue that you *had* to listen to before the doors would open.  Story wise (and this is where the EP2 spoilers come in), part one was fairly mediocre, but with an interesting twist at the end. As for part two, the story was just bad. Basically, Elizabeth goes to rapture to rescue a little girl. For some reason (that never seems to be adequately explained), going back to rapture causes Elizabeth to lose all her powers. It is eventually revealed that, apparently, she saw everything that would happen beforehand, and still decided to go, even though it would kill her. Yes, she can apparently see all possible realities, and goes on a long, difficult, journey, and gets herself killed because she's too dumb to just tear a hole into rapture right next to the girl and just grab her.  One other thing I should note, is that episode two is by far the longer episode, and has much more content. On the whole, episode two is the better part, but you need episode one in order to have any idea what's going on. If Burial at Sea is ever heavily discounted, I would recommend it for the gameplay, but know that the story is not really worth your time.",-1,0

The gameplay is more action-based than standard MMO's.You're free to attack and dodge as you like. You can also choose several types of powers for your character, mostly from DC heroes/villains. The game caps out at the low level of 30, however, and from what I've heard, DCUO doesn't have much endgame, so this likely a game you'll play through once or twice before stopping.  The intro cutscene is great. The tutorial is pretty good. Character creation is fun (pick flying as transportation power). A lot of voice acting is done by people who have played the roles previously, like Mark Hamill as The Joker. Graphics are good, music is forgettable.

241540,State of Decay,"An open-world zombie game that's kinda more than the sum of its parts. The graphics are mid-tier. The sound and voice work are mid-tier. The design is some mid-tier ♥♥♥ mid-tier-ness. But taken as a whole, State of Decay is a surprisingly compelling experience. Combat isn't anything special, but it feels solid. The characters are nothing to write home about, but you kinda develop your own attachments after playing them. The zombies are, well, zombies. Make of that what you will.  With a little more polish, this game could be incredible. Without it, it's still a surprisingly good time, if you're into survival management/zombie fighting in an open world.",1,0
349040,NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 4,"Honestly I thought this game was really bad as they hyped it up so much. I bought the pre order thinking that it would be as good as revolution and 3. But I could only bare about an hour of the laggy fps, buggy sound etc... So I closed this game thinking this was just wasted money.  However CyberConnect saw our pain and fixed this and I think this is probably the best things I have seen in a while. I played the story mose and loved it but I could not play with the lag especially when using ultimate jutsus it would just lag and it would be like watching a slideshow. However now this is fixed I am getting 60fps it looks amazing, lots of characters to choose from. There is an Adventure Mode aswell as a story mode and free battle which are a lot of modes to play along with the Online battle. Just by playing this game for another hour with no lag no nothing I really think this game could beat the previous Naruto games.",1,0

38600,Faerie Solitaire,"Strangely enough, this is a pretty addicting game.  I myself am not the biggest fan of puzzle games, definitely not when it comes to games such as Solitaire. However, this game got some great additions that makes it better than just Solitaire. For example, there is an adventure mode where you go through a lot of levels of story telling. There are also challenges and a quick play mode.  But this definitely isn't the Solitaire you would expect. You can purchase upgrades in the Faerie land which makes the game far more easier for you. Then there's the ability to evolve pets. Whenever you complete a row of cards, there is a possibility an egg will be behind it, which you can breed and evolve. Though the game did tell me that these could also work in your advantage, I haven't seen too many changes because of them yet.  This game does have flaws though, being that the story is completely ignorable and the ending is even more terrible. Evolving your pets also take way too long and so does the adventure mode. I also didn't care for the music, which I just put off and played my own music.  As a final verdict, this is more of a casual game that you pick up whenever you have nothing better to do. Do only purchase the game when it is on sale or really cheap, otherwise it is not worth it. It is a pretty fun and addicting game, but it stays with that.",1,0

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"This game's PC port is not good, even according to my benchmarks. I have had several issues with this game so far and here is the list:    Graphics are lacking; it could have been much better for PC. However, the console versions look great.   Performance tends to drop when moving through one city to another.   Sometimes turning off VSync and AA improves performance, but not by much.    When racing through tracks, using the Riddler Blocker tends to pause the game every half second that it's activated. Unsure if that is input lag according to the controller.   Stuttering occurs frequently in the game when moving throughout for some, even that it becomes unplayable for some who first drive the batmobile.   Vsync locks it to 30 frames which signifies poor performance and/or implementation.   My advice: Wait for a patch and more reviews to release, but skip for now if you have a minimum-requirement computer. A future review may be in the works later down the line. I'll update the review as I go along with further updates and announcements.  6/27/15 UPDATE #1: An announcement has been posted stating that Rocksteady and Iron Galaxy Studios are now focusing on the performance and graphical fidelity for the PC version. A user named Batsassin has posted an improvement of graphical fidelity here (the left image is the improvement)  http://i.imgur.com/hV7ZNH0.jpg",-1,1

However, the fact that:  1. I am unable to block in a hack-and-slash RPG where I don't have range attacks 2. There is a too clear recycling of the same enemies for far too long, with very little different between enemy types anyway 3. Stale and repetitive dialogue/quests 4. Repetitive/unimaginative upgrade system and weak gear/items 5. No real immersion or reason that pushes you keep wanting to play  These things really are things that kill enjoyment of the game and seriously affect the gameplay and experience.  For its price I got a couple of solid hours of entertainment out of it before yawning and discarding it into the pile of games that simply weren't good enough to bother finishing, and I guess perhaps that isn't too bad considering its a low priced indie title. Either way, I expected more and was simply so very underwhelmed and disappointed.",-1,0

There's so much content, a very big modding community, and extreme replay value. Every world is different in it's own way and you can play your separate characters however you want.

269210,Hero Siege,"Hero Siege is a really fun Rogue-like RPG,with some unique elements to it.It differs from from the ''room-after-room'' template and has 100+ different and unique to each other stages,all filled with countless waves of monsters for you to kill.It is very action packed,but has a slight strategic element to it,allowing you to build your character the way you want to,instead of being linear in terms of progression.  Unfortunately,no game is perfect.If you do choose to pick this game up(and i recommend you to do),expect a few of your runs to end unexpectedly.At the current state of the game,there are a couple of ways you can almost instantly die,no matter where you are,or at what stage/difficulty you are on.Furthermore,the successfulness of your run heavily depends on the items you get,and not so much on your character and the way you have built him(Your character's and your own skill can't take you to the endgame without some items to back you up).The lack of tutorial is a double-edged sword,since even if you cant understand anything about the game from the start,it is verry fun to learn everything yourself.  Overral,i would reccomend buying this game if you want a way to waste your free time.It doesn't contain micro-transactions and has more than a lot of potential,so that's a plus in my books.At it's current state you can't play it ''full-time'' but it's hella fun to play when you have nothing else better to do(it's better that shooting birds at pigs while waiting for the bus at least).  8/10 For this one",1,0

Things are hinted at and left up to the player to imagine. The game is definitely better with the General Knox and Claptrap DLC. The ending is a bit of a let down, and they improve on the endings in the DLC - but still the original game might leave some wanting and this makes a poor platform from which to try and sell DLC.",1,0

359320,Elite Dangerous,"Let me just start by saying I am currently no longer playing this game, I am however giving it a positive review because of its potential. Right now this game is an empty shell.  I say this because they made the game's universe SO VAST, that there are not enough players to truely fill the void in space. With over 100 Billion solar systems in game, it would take more than 14 times the population of the entire planet to put 1 person in every system at once. The probability of meeting another player once you get so many light years away from the starting zone drop drastically...even if this game had a population like World of Warcraft the odds are still going to be less than 1 in several million. For this reason I am no longer playing this game...sure theres plenty to do, but its downright boring if you dont bring your own friends along.  That rant aside, I will still give this a positive review because once they figure out a way to bring the players together either to help or harm one another, this game has the potential to be one incredibly epic experience. Think Eve Online with 1st person dogfighting instead of passive spreadsheeting and orbiting while shooting, here gear and skillpoints dont make the winner, skill does. The skill to know when to fight and when to run, the same skill that makes sure you earn credits instead of losing them, and the very same skill that at the end of the day rewards you with loot, cash, and the means to upgrade. A few months from now I think I'll revisit and check out the social changes, I have a feeling it will be an amazing experience.",1,0

It's basically a 16 bit version of Hatred but fantasy based. I felt no drive to continue the story as it wasn't a grey and grey scenario with you playing the villain fighting against an equally villainous regime, you're the bad guy. Your character states it cleanly several times he just wants to kill everyone and make as many people suffer as possible. And that just rubs me the wrong way really. Then again I'm the kind of guy who can't play Dark Side in the Knights of the Old Republic games. It feels like a mean-spirited reskin of Crystalis now that I really think about it. Nah, I wouldn't say this is a bad game or even badly made but it's definitely not for me. Grab if you don't mind being a virtual omnicidal maniac however.",-1,0

But I cannot recommend this game to anyone at this current state. I have encountered so many bugs in my playthroughs. most of them are tolerable and not game breaking. But some of them in my opinion break the combat gameplay completely. There are dozen of times that my soldiers or the enemy have vision on each other through the roof and through wall, which makes positioning and strategy meaningless, and it only makes a few of these to turn a welll-laid plan into a disaster in iron-man or even normal playthrough. I don't know how these bugs made through the initial QA. the fact is that I really like the procedurally generated maps, but I guess these maps make the bugs more elusive - appear in some or not others. For the combat gameplay to work as it should, these bugs must be ironed out.",-1,1

24420,Aquaria,"Aquaria is a strange game. Made by Derek Yu, the driving force behind indie darling Spelunky, Aquaria has not made quite the splash (pardon the pun) that Spelunky made. This is a shame because Aquaria is an amazing game and a fantastic entry into the metroidvania genre. The art and music and both top notch and the world is hauntingly beautiful but still dangerous and challenging. The game is also a joy to control with the caveat that you plug in a controller first. The game flaunts its 'mouse only' controls but these are a pain and take away from the game so I highly recommend a controller. You gain powerups in the form of songs and must sing the songs in order to activate the powerup which leads to tense situations where you struggle to sing the songs as quickly as possible. It is tense and functional but also a bit comedic. The story isn't really game changing but it is there and works with what the game is trying to accomplish.

2360,HeXen: Beyond Heretic,"This game is not for people who have only played DOOM-cubed. This game is for people who played ClassicDOOM on DOS. Released during the same era of gaming, Hexen is, as the title suggests, the sequel to Heretic. I actually never played this in its heyday, so this is actually a new experience for me. I didn't understand the hub system when I was younger, so never actually touched Hexen until just recently.  In this game, instead of being just one 'DOOMguy' or 'Corvus/Hereticguy/FantasyDOOMguy,' you can choose one of three classes: a Fighter, a Cleric, or Mage. Each have their strengths and weaknesses, and will actually use certain items/powerups in the game differently, most notably the Flechette. The demos that play if you don't create a new game are a bit misleading, as they suggest that each class has a different set of levels to playthrough. Or, they did for me anyway. I quickly figured out that is not the case, and was a little disappointed at first, but quickly got over it. Now that I'm older, I understand the Hub system better and am able to navigate through the levels easier. One thing I would stress: explore everywhere. Don't leave any portion of your maps blank if you can help it. Some important switches are hidden in easily-disregarded places, and you will find yourself stuck if you don't throw/flip them.  People looking for 'new and exciting ame mechanics' will likely be very disappointed. As far as I know, this particular iteration of a hub system has not been recreated for any other (popular) FPS-type game outside the Heretic franchise. But, if you played these games and similar during their heyday, I would highly recommend getting them for a trip down Memory Lane.  (Also, the price of these games in the bundle can't be beat. Ten bucks for four games? That's $2.50 USD per game!)",1,0

The story isn't exactly anything to write home about, but that's easily forgiven with how 'mature' this game is. From potshots at gaming companies, cameos out the whazoo from game devs and gaming icons alike, lookalike and soundalike references from games of the past and mixed in with a lot of tongue-in-cheek wisecracks that are designed to get you to bust a gut out laughing, there is absolutely no reason as to why this title should not be in your collection.",1,0

Why the ♥♥♥♥ everyone use this ♥♥♥♥ effect. It’s like I did good picture let me ♥♥♥♥ on it now it’s perfect ♥♥♥♥ OFF it’s not. • Other shity effects that have no sens like rain drop only visible when the fire is on the screen, dirty lens or some ♥♥♥♥. I would be maybe ok if the camera was behind character but here you have this weird isometric point of view so how the ♥♥♥♥ I have drops on the camera? • Camera… really why this view? Half of the time is obscuring your character and obstacles. Some time when you going back in mission you see less because of the angle but your enemy’s can see you just fine… Why this is not TPP in style of a Hitman 1,2,3,4? It’s just begs for that. • Environmental destruction I will never understand this gimmick you can blow up a house but you can’t run over a bin with your car… you can disintegrate tree with your car but bins, and billboards are made from ♥♥♥♥ing diamond, titan and ♥♥♥♥ing adamantium … I don’t know…  • Character can get stuck on everything • And billions other things  Good thing… It’s kinda violent only when you perform executions other than that I saw better games in violence department Kingpin, Soldier of Fortune even Hotline Miami. Game should be relaxing, stress relieving but it’s just frustrating. Looking for a violent game buy Hotline Miami 2 way better",-1,0

345180,Victor Vran,"This review is in three segements.  1: Mechanics  2: Visual's and performance  3: Story   Mechanically wise this is game perfect, there are no other words for it. The gameplay mechanics are so beautifully refined, it's just so fun, I find myself learning enemy attack patterns too better defeat them, I constantly make sure I am using the best possible weapon all while trying new ones, and same goes for Demons Powers and Destiny Cards. Mechanic wise this game gets a 9 outta 10. The reason for it not being a 10 is for one very minor, but still quite annoying detail is the camera, the angle for isn't quite right and sometimes I find myself running staright into a bunch of enemies that I couldn't see due to camera looking down to much. But other than that Mechanics are just fine.  *For details on some of the mechanics in the game, they are located at the bottom of this review*  For Visual and Performance this game isn't too bad for a 3rd person RPG, Hack and Slash. All though the higher graphics does seem to tank on my PC, but that doesn't make the game unplayable. I prefer low graphics to high, I'll happily sacrifice high quality if it means I get 10 extra FPS, It's just my personal preference. I give Visuals and Performance a 8 outta 10.   And finally for Story, I have only played up too the first major boss and so far it's not bad, it doesn't really hook me in, but I'm honestly here for the hack and slash, but it's so far it looks to be your generic 'Main Character Saves World and Is Undefeated'. But one thing I do like is the over head voice, he is absolutely hilarious... sometimes, and I love the little easter eggs where he talks about other games, for example he accidently calls the player 'Stanley' from the Stanely Parable game, as the voice actor from that game is the same voice actor in Victor Vran. So for Story I give it a 9 outta 10.  Overall this game is brilliant, this is my first Hack and Slash RPG and I am absolutely love it and will definitely play it too completion. I give this game 9 out of 10.   *For anyone curious on how the game works here is a quick overview, At the beginning you start off with 1 weapon slot, 1 potion slot. With all the weapons there are 1 primary attack and 2 secondary, the primary attack is a basic hit, the secondary's however are different depending on what weapon you have, a hammer can do a slam down type attack, or a charged attack, doing allot more damage, there are also shotguns with precise shots and scatter as well. Potions being things like health and some others as you progress. As you gain experience your weapon and potion slots can increase to 2 and can switch between the 2. Later in the game you can acquire Destiny Cards or Demon Powers. Destiny cards give you permeant passive abilities too aid you in the game, it can be more HP, more damage and bunch of stuff. Demon powers are incredibly powerful abilities, either being offensive or defensive and can be activated by chaining kills together in order to fill a meter, once the meter is full you are able to use the demon power, these are just some basic stuff, the game expands allot more in the future*.  *Discloser* This review is based on my own personal expirence and everything said here is of my own opinion. If you disagree with anything said here you can wake up and realize this isn't set in stone and the game tailors too many people for many different reasons, and usually not one person see's the same thing, the same way.",1,0

Unfortunately for me, Five Nights at Freddy's 2, feels like the exact same game with only minor differences that do little to change the experience. The jump scares seemed more predictable, and thus were not remotely scary, and the mechanics came down to once again pressing buttons and clicking the mouse in the right places as fast as possible without making a mistake.   If you loved Five Nights at Freddy's, you will probably love this game as it really is more of the same. But for me, it is one to miss.",-1,1
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"In a nutshell Dark Souls is a fantastic RPG, however it is nearly unplayable without the DSFix patch which at the minute doesn't appear to be working, or not working well with the transition to steam instead of GFWL (for me at least).  Once you have the patch installed and the graphical issues sorted out, the game is much less of a chore to play. In many ways it is a better game than Dark Souls II, the world just feels better to explore and learn about. I don't know what it is about Dark Souls but Lordran is just fascinating. The game is not half as hard as most people would have you believe, it's certainly challenging but not unfair. The aesthetic is terrific, and the world feels well designed and put together.  Basically, if you don't mind putting a bit of time in to get past the initially tough learning curve and installing the patch, it's a great game, and well worth your time.  Oh, and don't bother trying to play it with anything other than a gamepad, a gamepad is basically essential.",1,0

I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a great game to play, and although the whole 'Paying for a game' is sort of a novelty these days, ESPECIALLY for an MMO (because Free to Play exists), but this one is worth SO much more.

Sonic Adventure 2 is one of the most loved games in the franchise &amp; I can understand why, they game does many things right, but it is perhaps a little overrated. The game suffers from many of the same problems that plauged many 3D games at the time, the camera isn't always positioned in the best place and the lack of a free moving camera doesn't help this. The animation in cutscenes is a little awkard and the english dialouge is a bit 'cheesy'.

That being said it is worth the 12 bucks it cost and everyone who hasn't played a EDF should and with friends. I had no problems with this game online and off (There is allot to be said about that) The PC version gets a big thumbs up compared to the console version. Only wish the 4k video setting worked.

And, while I wish the campaign were longer, I very much enjoyed the storyline and concept, as well as the gameplay. 8/10, 4/5, 16/20, 2/2.5, 2384/2980. Would recommend to play.",1,0
58610,Wargame: European Escalation,"This depends what you're looking for. If you're looking for another Company of Heroes style arcade top-down action game with NATO/Warsaw Pact units, a larger scale and some plausible alternative-history scenarios, but with a fiddly UI, go for it. Similarly, the game would be decent in MP, where the numerous issues with the SP campaign wouldn't apply.  But if you're looking for 'an intense and spectacular Real Time Strategy game, where realism and strategy are brought to the front lines.', as per the marketing spin on the Steam store page, try somewhere else. This is barely more realistic than the latest Command and Conquer: Red Alert (indeed, the infantry in C&amp;C behave more realistically than the stunned mullets in Wargame:EE). Command and control, deployment, force mix, it's all over the shop. A fun top-down action game it may make, but a quality, realistic RTS it most definitely isn't, and as I picked it up based on what the developers said it was, I'm rating it accordingly.  Some really promising individual unit combat mechanics let down by horrendous level design in single player (ridiculously unrealistic force layouts, spawning at the start of levels with nothing but command units and a couple of choppers with the enemy within a couple of kilometres, and mission objectives that wouldn't have passed the common sense test with anyone with any military knowledge higher than a passing familiarity with Hogan's Heroes). All being well Eugen improved with their sequels, but European Escalation was a hue step back from RUSE.  Which is another point - the UI is appaling. It was easy to play RUSE with a gamepad than it is to play Wargame:EE with a mouse and keyboard. While RUSE's pad controls were well designed, an RTS should _always_ be better with a mouse/kb.  And then there's unit behaviour. Infantry suddenly come across an enemy strongpoint in town? They'll sit in the middle of the street getting slaughtered, rather than take cover. Clearly the NATO and Warsaw Pact troops selected as AI models for Wargame: EE hadn't actually done any military training yet ;).  All is not lost, however - while Eugen still hadn't quite got it right with Wargame: AirLand Battle (Better UI but still no time control), Wargame: Red Dragon has an improved UI and allows you to slow to a very slow speed, enabling appropriate single-player command over a varied force on a large map, and lets you deploy a force of your choice before the battle kicks off, and is well worth a look for SP RTS fans with an eye for realism.",-1,0

230410,Warframe,"There really is no 'truth' when dealing with, well, really anything. So instead of spouting 'Ermahgherd I kno da TRUF' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I'm going to tell you why I personally dislike this game from the standpoint of someone who can bear to stand these F2P models, as it were.   Firstly, the combat is nice. It's fluid, and decently done. But that's essentially the extent of it. You have some weapon categories that you can either craft or buy, but I'll get to that later. The same goes for the classes, here called 'Frames'. You have your generic 'Excalibur' frame, and more exotic ones such as 'Void' and 'Equinox'. Again, these can be crafted or bought.   This brings me to the talk of the town: The grind.   The developers once said that they didn't want a grindy experience.   Look where we are now :T  You could spend   DAYS   grinding the resources for weapons and frames, and even   MORE   days building the faking things, but in the end, it's all enrirely useless.   Then comes the buisness model, which is verging on apalling. 'Pay 2 Convenience', sure, but it's getting damn close to 'Pay 2 Have Fun'. Think of this system as that of a mobile game, complete with the ♥♥♥♥ing time and pay walls, the urgance for you to pay their damn premium currency, and the audacity for them to make their flagship item, the frames themselves, so damn expensive. You have credits, right, the useless things that do nothing, and the plats, the actual currency. Most weapons are around 100-300 plats, or around 7-21 dollars in real cash. The warframes? 200-450 plats, or around 14-31.5 dollars   in real cash.    My final words will be: How ♥♥♥♥ing dare you DE. You only want money from this, I can see through the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I'm not caving anymore, I'm burnt, as they say. I know you most likely don't care, and fair enough, but people have and will wise up to this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.   Don't be another OVERKILL.

Lol if you pay $60 for those buggy excuse for games.   Please do not judge the game for its graphics. I know it looks super dated because of the source engine but the audio is actually first class.

Now that it's out I'm happy to say its an eminently playable Turn Based squad game. It needs more polishing, but for something to fill that desperate gap in games of this type it's perfect.   Dont expect JA3. This isnt a big budget sequel, it's a well crafted, very moddable, 'prequel'. It advances the graphics engine and has scope for lots of future additions which should mean that this game can last the test of time.

253650,Sparkle 2 Evo,"Sparkle 2 Evo is a casual game. You are an ocean dwelling creature. You eat and grow. There are basically 3 colors of food. Which color you consume the most will determine the type of creature you'll become: - red (carnivore) =&gt; you'll move fast but eat slowly - green (herbivore) =&gt; you'll eat fast but move slowly - blue (omnivore) =&gt; medium movement speed and medium eating speed  At first red, green and blue blobs just float in the ocean and you eat them to practice the movement of your creature. In later levels, you'll encounter other sea creatures in a variety of shapes but basically you always need to stay away from their head (or they will push you away) until you've eaten what parts of their body you can eat, and then go in for the kill by eating their head.   You can play the game in two modes: competitive mode (default) or 'casual mode'. I strongly suggest leaving competitive mode on and only switching it off if you find the game too hard, which isn't very likely. You see, the game gets pretty easy once you figured out how it works. You start at the top layer' of the ocean. You will see radar 'pings' in red, green or blue telling you in which direction there is food of that color. When you don't see any pings anymore, you go down to the next layer and look at your screen for radar pings. Again you hunt and eat until you don't see any pings anymore, then you go down to next layer and so on. If you want, you can focus (more) on one type of food to become your preferred creature type (carnivore, herbivore or omnivore) but in my opinion that is something better left for casual mode because in competitive mode, it's better to just eat everything you find.  The graphics are very nice. The music is very subtle and fitting. The Steam Achievements are easy to complete (you'll most likely complete them before you complete the game, unless you happened to miss something). It's a nice game to play for a few hours but don't expect something it's not. Don't expect a twitchy action game or a puzzle-like game that will challenge you for dozens of hours. If the game looks like something you might enjoy, I recommend giving it a go, especially if it's on sale.",1,0

219910,Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes,"Edna &amp; Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes is one of the best games I've played in a while. Got it on sale, but it's worth the full price! If you want to try it out first, the demo is well-done and represents the full game perfectly. No unpleasant surprises or packing all the good stuff into the beginning, like some other demos do.  I honestly can't think of many types of gamers who wouldn't appreciate this game. It's funny, it's messed up, it's cute, all in healthy doses. As far as difficulty goes, it's pretty simple but there are a good number of puzzles, all of them commanding some amount of thought. Unless you just hate point-and-click, there's very little chance that you'll dislike this game.  It's fully voice acted, and said actors' performances perfectly suit their characters and the overall mood of the game. The morbidly upbeat and often cheeky narration lends a lot of charm, putting a fun and quirky spin on the 'edgy' theme so prevalent in games today. The narrator himself is one of the game's best assets, the other being its sense of humor in that it embraces its dark subject matter, but doesn't take itself too seriously. There is truly a lot of charisma to this game.   Bonus: despite being a sequel featuring several characters from the first game, you don't have to play the first game to understand what's going on. It's written in such a way that those who played the original will enjoy the references, while those who didn't won't feel lost.  One caveat: Some of the puzzles are absolutely nonsensical, or at least require thinking that is outside the box in a 'so stupid it might actually work' sort of way. That, or I'm just bad at games. You should probably have a walkthrough on hand anyway, just to be safe.",1,0

439190,Stories: The Path of Destinies,"A marvelous surprise. This game has rather simple and straightforward combat much like Batman: Arkham Asylum or Assassin's Creed. Nothing revolutionary, but the story itself is a breath of fresh air. Our hero, Reynard, has to use a mystic book to find a powerful artifact and get help from his sneaky best friend to reunite with his lost love and defeat the evil empire and blah blah blah. The twist is that Reynald will DIE. So many times. And not in combat, but you get to make many choose-your-adventure choices. There are over a hundred paths to the end, and almost all of them end up with you getting executed by guards or blown up by the artifact you were trying to save or other unpleasant fates. But death is not the end - you have a magic book that brings you back to the start when you fail. Through your failures you learn Truths, depending on the path you take, and these ultimately help you find the one path to a golden ending.  Highly recommended!",1,0

Even though aimed at children, not being able to say Norse, Odin, Thor, Mjolnir, gods, and a plethora of other harmless words used in the Dragon series, is extremely ridiculous. I'm surprised at all they allowed my character to be called Nibelungenlied.   I downloaded the game to try to see if it was safe for the younger members of my family. But I'm not even sure it could hold their attention. The entire game is lifeless and bland. They would have more fun sitting there watching me play other titles, and doing nothing themselves. I don't even mind the membership ads. An online game has to keep servers running somehow. The control scheme is supremely archaic. And I mean that in the sense of early 90s experimental controls for PC. It is in no way optimized for modern gaming whatsoever.   Just....just don't. Don't bother downloading. The premise is freaking awesome, but the execution is extremely poor. Save yourself some time and go download Wizards 101 or Pirates 101 for your young ones.

291650,Pillars of Eternity,"I spent an hour making a character. This was after I decided I didn't have the time to read every race and culture description available. Once I started the action I was expecting a tutorial of some sort...I didn't get what I expected. You're dropped into the middle of the action and you pretty much have to figure out for yourself how you use your different skills/powers/spells. I am not a fan of linear adventures or being led around by the hand, but you have to train the players how to play the game before you have a total party kill. In total I spent 4 hours wandering around trying to figure out combat (I still don't know if I have as I have always been numerically superior in each engagement). Trying to figure out stealth and trap disarming. There was a little discussion about camping, but not enough to really figure it out. There are plenty of different races, cultures and occupations, which means there are a bunch of character builds. This so far is the only thing I can give an unmodified nod of approval to. Other aspects of the game not so much. The poor tutorial, and the extreme verbosity of narratives and exposition, makes every scene a grind. Don't buy this until it drops in price significantly and only if they fix the tutorial.",-1,0

It is a very pretty, story-driven adventure with believable characters and a few plot twists. And I was impressed by how much story and emotion was delivered with almost no dialog. Puzzles in the game are solved by using each brother's strengths (big brother is stronger and taller, little brother can squeeze through small gaps). The controls are about as simple as can be (I used a dual-analog gamepad, so not sure how it plays on keyboard) with only one stick and one button per brother, and two buttons for rotating the camera view.

268500,XCOM 2,"This game is freaking terrible! If you were a fan of the last reboot, and are wondering about whether or not to get this game, read this review!  You start most missions in concealed mode, which allows you to creep around the maps and set up an ambush. In this mode, Overwatch no longer has an aim penalty, so you could set all of your soldiers but one on Overwatch, and have the last one attack, or run out in the open to trigger a 'pod'. (Group of enemies that are just stood there) Once triggered, they will most likely run for cover, and your soldiers will shoot them.   Concealed mode is an interesting addition, but during the timed missions, where you are given 8 turns to complete the objective, or you fail the mission, you cant really be messing around slowly setting up an ambush to deal with the enemies. In this way, the game comes accross as having multiple personality disorder. Because of the new abilities the aliens have, you have to be very careful, running away and looking for cover. But because of the round timers that the developers have, you have to be very fast, making sure to get there on time. The developers also saw fit to remove the ability to 'dash' to a door or objective and activate it in the same turn. That means that you have to move there, and use your second action point to activate the objective, or dash there, and activate it on the next turn. Nearly all of the 8 turn missions I have attempted have been failed with one soldier standing right next to them, ready to activate it! FOR GOODNESS SAKES! I failed 8 missions in the campain, and completed 4, (some of them tutorial missions) on the easy difficulty, even though I have played the other game on impossible.  The aliens themselves have also been given much more power. Sectoids can now mind control, and appear just as early in the game as the last one. In the last game, only Sectoid Commanders could mind control, and you didn't encounter them until much later, when the research your scientists had done allowed you to manufacture advanced armours and weapons that leveled the playing field. Not only that, but Sectoids can also now raise the dead. So if one of your soldiers is unlucky (Literally, since the game is based around pseudo-random hit chances more than ever before...) not only does it hurt because you can attack the enemy once less per turn, but also it hurts because they can attack you once more per turn! Killing the offending Sectoid will kill all the zombies as well though, but unfortunatly, it is rare that you encounter a Sectoid all on it's own. It is often accompanied by a pair of 'stun' troopers. These aliens are also encountered early in the game, and can dash AND melee attack your troops in the same move! Not only that, but they have a high chance to stun your troops, robbing them of their next move. It is hard to run away from these troops AND reach the objectives in time. Not only that, but while you run away for more cover, which is the only strategy in these Xcom reboots (everything else is random, positioning is the only certainty (and suppresion /explosives )...) you will invariably trigger another pod of deadly aliens, which will surely slaughter your entire team in the next go.   What is also poorly explained, and completely ruined, is the geoscape. In the last game, you were given clear goals of what to do next, or what decisions you could afford to make. In this game, Everything is random. There are 11 continental perks, but there are only 6 continents. The game randomly picks your starting position, randomly picks 6 perks out of the 11 in the game, and randomly gives each continent one of those perks. I started in New India, in Asia.  In the last game, you had a scan button, which would advance time. In this game, there are Scan buttons located all over the map. These buttons are essentially like bars, that get filled up as you choose to scan at that location, instead of another. once you have scanned it empty, you get the reward from it, what ever that was. Now, instead of monthly funding, every month, the funds you would have got are put down on the map somewhere, and need to be scanned for three days. You also need to build communications centers in your base to be able to contact more regions, and the regions are contacted in linear order. Research and base management works the same, with a list of upcomming events that get completed as you scan in the map. Manufacturing works similarly, but now once you have manufactured certain items (Like armour or weapons) You only need to manufacture one, and every troop can have one.  There are certain missions in the game which advance the 'Advent' bar until completed, which when full, ends the game. These missions don't disapear after a day like the others, and can be attacked at anytime. But only if you have contact with the continent that it is located in. So if you dont have access to that mission, you will have to build a communications center. But if you don't have enough power, you will need to build a power plant. But if you don't have enough money to do that, you will need to scan around to get some. While scanning, there is a risk a pick two, or pick three mission will pop up. You can choose to ignore it if you want, but there are 2 or 3 negatives associated with each of those missions, such as all enemies will have armour for the next month, or your funding will be cut in half next month. You can only pick one of those missions, and the other two negatives will happen anyway. But it will be difficult to beat those missions, with the new timer mechanics, and unfair enemy powers. If you dont have enough time to wait for all the building either way, then you will lose the game.  There is no way to play the game like the last one in my opinion. Now, instead of being able to start a new playthrough and put on Ironman/Impossible, and follow through with a certain strategy you have been working on, the game does everything randomly, making it so you go in blind everytime. The old rules still apply to a deggree, elevation is good, blow up their cover, run away if you can to a more secure location, focus fire etc etc.  But all of those rules go out of the window randomly. You rely on cover? Well what about if one of the humans running around on the map randomly turns into a giant monster, that can walk up to your soldier on a balcony, and swipe it's claws, and completely destroy the building your team is stood on, in one move? You always know you can run away from the aliens to secure a much better environmental advantage, like higher cover or a vantage point? Aww, well, too bad, you got a mission that expects you to kill 10 aliens and hack the box in 8 turns, with four rookies, and devastating consequences for failure.    There are some positives though:  They fixed the mouse lag, making for a much more enjoyable user experience. The game also runs well for me on my old rig, so I don't know why some users are reporting performance issues, but it may be a driver issue or something. The game looks pretty good as well. The game features well done randomly generated maps. The designs, the music, the sound are all great! One great moment I recall was a grenade knocking a soldier into a train, only to have a 'BANG' play, as his body hit the metal train! xD The game is also much more snappier than before, it's very responsive and less time-wastie to give orders and pan the camera. The game world and designs ooze atmosphere also.   The tactical randomness lets the game down imo. You shouldn't have to mod the game to give you one or two more turns, that's something the developers should have anticipated.",-1,0

15620,"Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II","Dawn of War II is perhaps the best example of a sequel outside of StarCraft II in the RTS genre. While it tossed out Base Building for a more streamlined approach, it did so with flying colors combining Diablo style loot drops with an RPG leveling system and an extensive skill tree.  Pros: +Decent story with likeable characters +Excellent loot, weapon, armor, and class variety +Great graphics and animations that still hold up to todays standards for RTS games, especially for 2009 +TONS OF CONTENT! On top of a 20+ hour campaign that is highly replayable, you have Co-Op on top of that. (The online modes should be played exclusively on DoW II Retribution though as that has ALL the factions and the majority of the community.) +Fantastic combat with great enemy variety, boss battles, special enemy types, and lots of guns, powers, and toys to play around with +Huge open maps meant for exploration to find loot and other goodies as well as mop up any enemies to rack the experience points. +Decent mission variety with story missions being the most focused with optional Assassination and Defense missions to spice it up +The voice acting is SUPERB with some of the best game actors in the biz working it, including Steve Blum, aka Spike from Cowboy Beebop in this game as a grizzled Sniper expert +ITS WARHAMMER 40K! If you love the franchise like I do you will be splooging at all the detail, lore, and awesome stuff that helps build upon the license and makes you giddy just to feel like youre in the universe of W40K  Con: -Graphics are great overall, but there is some serious texture quality that is left to be desired, like the ground for instance -While the maps are expansive and fun to explore they repeat them CONSTANTLY in the game. It gets repeitive doing the same maps over and over, but it's the quality of the gameplay and the map design that save this unfortunate problem -Cant respec skill tree :( -Still suffers from bugs. Nothing major, but there are occasional animation bugs where units may get stuck or cant move, and enemies who get killed may fly in circles around the map. It's actually kind of funny when you see that one though -Along with repeating maps the missions themselves feel very repetitive after a while. It's the differing enemy types and awesome loot drops that encourage you to play these and save this unforunate repetition -While the writing is passable by W40K fans, most people will see it as stock and cliche. It really is the setting and license that hold it up. The characters are memorable and likeable enough, but fairly one dimensional in personality and you really need to listen to a LOT of their dialog to feel invested  OVERALL: Fantastic I mean no exageration when I award this a 9.5/10 as a W40K fan. As an RTS/RPG fan, I award it an 8.5 for those not familiar with W40K. An excellent game none the less and one of my favorite games of all time and my favorite RTS alongside StarCraft II. An easy buy.",1,0

Im 26 year and i have to admit, games of this kind already more enjoable than every shooter. The story that you are witnessing is so intense and fascinating. How thy talk and interact with each other is just so cool. Of corse there is not much to do for you as player in terms of puzzels or getting active, its more like a interactive movie where you set the pace. To be honest i rater play a game like this for 4 hours that has a tight and full packed story, than some open world game that last 10 hours but is streched out at any occasion and has much idle inbetween. This game is a little masterpiece, its the kind of game you only will get from little indie game developers, so much love to the detail, such an original gameidea.

397950,Clustertruck,"What started its life as a widely distributed pre-alpha with an amazing concept but muddy controls and mechanics, has somehow pulled off a rapid turnaround and now has a pretty brilliantly designed repertoire of levels, controls with which you can actually beat them, and a snazzy OST to boot.  The floor is lava. Jump from truck to truck to get to the goal. Also, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ physics. So the elevator pitch is simple but the game is anything but, as you contend with variable terrain and hazards ranging from springboards, trapdoors and crushers, to lasers, flamethrowers, building-sized cogs, situational modifiers chosen via Twitch roulette if you're the type who likes to stream, and even a final boss that can  EAT A ♥♥♥♥ OH MY GOD ♥♥♥♥ THAT LEVEL.   It's both frustrating and rewarding. Sometimes you'll feel a sense of progression as you chip away at a series of obstacles. Sometimes the game's odd system of inertia will push you clear off of a slow-moving truck you pinpointed a perfect landing on. Sometimes things will be completely out of your hands as the level's supply of trucks is ultimately destroyed or derailed, leaving you with no means to finish. Unlockable mobility and utility powerups give you some flexibility in how to approach levels and refine your clear times if you're into speedrunning, but be aware that the random Twitch modifiers can end up breaking level records clean in half if you're smart with them. It's a bit of an unfair system.  What it really delivers on is a single-player party game experience. If you have an online audience they get to mess with you, and even if not there's enough chaos to keep you well entertained if you're not too obsessed with playing the game optimally. There's even a level editor to boot, so here's hoping the community comes up with some insane garbage to make the game last beyond the 90 campaign levels.  There are as of yet some weird performance issues with some GPU's though, particularly the mid-range GTX line. Fingers crossed these get ironed out soon.",1,0

211400,Deadlight,"Some men are Dead to Rights. Others are Dead to Lights. And then a few still, who lack the proper character limits, are Deadlight. This is a story of a man who is Deadlight.  In Deadlight, you play as a man with a beard who is looking for his family. He talks to other survivors, and then zombies kill them and he kills the zombies. There are flashback scenes, and grittily stylized 2D motion comic cutscenes. Eventually the zombies are replaced with the worst kind of men--mad men. They are even worse than the underground platforming dungeons of the rat men who literally call themselves The Rat in an epic blunder clearly lacking any degree of subtlety or self-awareness. There is no subtlety in this world. Only death. Memento mori. RIP.  But during all of this thrilling and very thoughtful storytelling, there is something... wrong. There is something off about this whole experience. Maybe you don't realize it yet, but the main character does, slowly.

Biggest gripe here. 2.Extra missions (Theatre of War) and DLC that is not play-tested after balance patches. Try Tiger Ace on General. 3.Machine gunners that can't hit blobs the size of Mississippi. 4.Watching soldiers soak up bullets and stand there with hardly a grimace (goes for both sides). 5.Micromanaging your AT guns to oblivion. 6. An inaccurate portrayal of WWII in Russia. 7. Bouncing your tiger's 88 over ten times off of KV armor, while it's 76 penetrates your tiger's thicker front armor. 8. German OKW soldiers having a huge advantage over US forces. 9. Stereotypical British sayings.  DON'T buy this game if you like: 1. Any realism. Honestly, it's gone. 2. Keeping all your hair. You'll be ripping it out by the time you're done. 3. Complete and tested WWII masterpieces.  Relic.. How did you make such a mess? I have a problem with tanks that would one-shot enemy lighter tanks in real life taking five hits to destroy the enemy in-game.

Then theres a very noticeable text bug in the Beerus saga. Supreme Kai of Time read a line after the fight due to her....cooking.....(not complaining about this scene, it was actually funny) The text bubble has a whole different line instead of what she actually says. And lets address the BS that comes with the game still responding to Keys and/or Controller movement when tabbed out. This is seriously frustrating since I was tabbed out in the menu, and as I type things out and hit enter on other windows. The game is responding to all these inputs and boom, deletes my main character.   Simply awful. I would love to change my view on this, but until this is fixed, ill keep it negative.",-1,0

8870,BioShock Infinite,"The floating city of Columbia is a joy to explore. This is due to Columbia being aesthetically perfect. All the tiny details make the world seem like a real place. It's a shame that not everything else within the game fits together which such cohesion.  Vigors, which replace the plasmids of the first two games, grant the player powerful abilities. Though these completely brake from the immersion of the experience as they do not fit within the right-winged, religious setting of Columbia. The acceptance and the creation of the Vigors is never explained and are completely tacked on so the game can be seen as a Bioshock sequel. Though the inclusion makes the gameplay more interesting.  Elizabeth is a wonderful character who you will truly care about and is also helpful as she aids you in combat and other activities. It's a shame that other NPCs are not the same. The characters that you come across in the street have a set phrase of dialogue when you approach them and then will continue to completely ignore your presence. This, for me, is another area in which the world falls apart.  Though apart from these criticisms the game as a whole is fantastic. It's not perfect but you could spend your money on a lot worse.",1,0

417860,Emily is Away,"probably not for people who play actual visual novels. whenever you pick an option you have to type it out but thats too much work so just bash the keys and get it over with. i couldnt find any option to skip this, making it extremely tiring if you want to play through the game again. theres really only 2 endings where emily either stops talking to you or you get bored of talking to eachother, besides, if there were other endings that would be fun to get you'd still have to sit through the god damn typing. the other aspect of the game is that you have to play along, which is a pet peeve of mine in any fiction. you have to make up what happened outside of talking to emily yourself and you will probably end up just for fun disliking characters that have little to no elaboration on them. game never asks for your gender, so if you're a woman enjoy your possibly temporary homosexuality. theres no response to outright reject any advances emily tries to make for you (probably out of fear of homophobia or some stupid ♥♥♥♥) you never get the option of saying you're not a lesbian/interested in her. i always felt different ways when emily would say something than the dialogue would give. for the heck of it i let her come over and visit me at college for the weekend then it starts acting like shes accusing me of having taken advantage of her in a vulnerable time. i really wanted to tell her to ♥♥♥♥ off, and the game is never clear over what actually happened over that period of time because you're only given the portion of the story for when you're talking directly to emily. that makes things super confusing because it's incredibly hard to deliver a reaction to something if you dont even know the details of what happened. overall pretty awful in terms of story (which is pretty much what the entire game is tbh). save yourself the time and play something else.",-1,0

The story in AC2 is also beautifully crafted as you go round hunting down the men responsible for your father and brother's death. The combat in AC2 isn't on par with later AC games' ones as the combat in AC2 isn't as fluid as kill streaks weren't introduced yet, thus the combat is a little similar to AC1's.

410820,Starward Rogue,"I'm rather confused as to why the reviews for this game are so positive. Put simply, this is an amateur rouglike with good controls and gameplay mechanics, but very poor visual and audio design, which is why it didn't keep me interested.  For example, when bullets hit a wall, there is no 'hit' sound effect or animation. It just dissapears, which makes the bullets feel like nothing. There are many other examples where audio/visuals are missing or thouroughly underwhelming: boosting, teleporting, changing rooms, using energy weapons, picking up items, the main menu, etc. The lack of satisfying audio/visual feedback makes it near impossible for me to get immersed in the game.  Gameplay wise, the bullet hell gameplay usually works except for the enemies and mini-bosses with completely useless AI and/or bullet patterns.  Overall, I would only recommend this game if you have a ridiculously strong love for indie bullet hells and/or Arcen Games.",-1,1

Since I played this first, I felt let down by delegating instead of becoming the characters in other games.  Hence I put a lot of time into this. Would play the other games if released on steam.",1,0

431730,Aseprite,"I started off with Photoshop, then I moved on to Krita, photoshop was horrendous on animation, and extremely expensive to license, and Krita felt messy to me, I then finally got Aseprite reccommended to me!  Aseprite is a cheap-priced, yet high-quality product, that thanks to it's focus on pixel-art, has built-in tools specified for pixelart such as border and outline selections, the shading brush, a 'RotSprite' rotation to keep sprites much much more intact when rotated instead of turning them into a fuzzy mess, and plenty more that I haven't even got to yet after 40 hours of real-time-use! The animation is the smoothest I had yet, looking similar to high-end animation programs by having all the layers and their frames presented together, making it easy to animate different layers, along with the option to move an entire animated layer without having to move each layer seperately, this product is not only incredibly easy-to-use for regular sprite animations for a game, with it's option for reverse and ping-pong animation, but it also allowed me to comfortably and easily create gif scenes to post on my pixelart blog, something that I do on a regular basis.  Skipping going deep into other features, like how amazing the pallette managment is, I also have to mention that the developer is extremely responsive, always answering suggestions and questions on the forums, taking away from them ideas for features to add, his support is simply great!  For 15$ only, which is a sum even an unsure-beginner (and easily anyone who is serious about spriting and game-making) can easily afford to spend, this product gives you everything you need, 10/10!.",1,0

288470,Fable Anniversary,"Fable Anniversary is a prime example of how NOT to handle a re-mastered game.   I love the Fable series to death. TLC remains my favorite RPG to date. Some compatibility issues prevent me from playing the original Fable TLC on my PC, so I purchased FA in order to still play it. While the general gameplay is exactly the same, they destroyed everything else.   First of all, this was supposed to IMPROVE the graphics: not just add more polygons and change the lighting. The textures are horrible, the models are even worse, and the lighting makes me want to carve out my own eyes. Everything is incredibly dull and grey - the opposite of the original, bright and colorful Fable.   What's worse than the graphics is the menu system. At first there was no mouse support for any of the menus. NO MOUSE SUPPORT ON A PC GAME. Okay, it's not THAT big of a deal, right? We can still use the arrow keys and 'enter', right? Nope. You use Insert and Delete to navigate. Explain this sh*t to me.   They have since updated the game, and we can now use a mouse in the menus. However, they are still the clunkiest, unnecessarily difficult menus I have ever used. This is the worst part of the game being ported from Xbox.   All in all, this game is the worst console port I have ever played. It's literally a port of a port, and it shows. I'll still play it because it's Fable, but as usual I'm quite irritated with Micro$oft and Lionhead Studios. If you're going to continue milking this franchise, how about you give us something we want: like FABLE F*CKING 2 FOR PC.",-1,1

394510,HELLDIVERS™,"This game is hella-fun in a group. The online community is a mixed bag (as normal with these types of games), but with all of the mechanics that encourage cooperation I think it's slightly above average.  There are a ton of specials ('strategems' in game lingo) that you call down in the field, and a very good selection of weapons that feel pretty unique. The DLC is priced reasonably and not overpowered in-game.  The most important peice of advice I can give new players is this: Everything will kill you. Everything. Calling down an ammo drop? Don't stand to close, 'cause it'll kill you. Think the game will keep you from walking into that hole? Nope, it'll kill you. Your buddy has an itchy trigger finger? His bullets will kill you. You'll die a *lot* at first (or in a bad group), but the penlty for death is very light and it doesn't make the game less fun. In fact, it can provide for some hilarity.  There is a nice system of up-/down-voting the players you group with so the griefers can trickle down and grief each other while the others won't have to deal with them as much. I'm sure it's not a perfect system, but I can think of many games that would benefit from this system.  Also, your efforts are sent to the server. As players win victories against the other factions, the way slowly opens up to that faction's homeworld. Beat that, and that faction is out for the remainder of the current war.  TLDR: Good variety in weapons, fun gameplay, your actions feel like they have meaning, TONS of upgrades, multi-person vehicles, cosmetic options. Thumbs up.",1,0

281640,The Banner Saga 2,"TL;DR: Game doesn't cost a lot at all, which partly justifies it's length, but if you want the whole story — you'd better off waiting for the trequel. This chapter blatantly cuts off game's story with a by-the-book cliffhanger as if it was some TV-series.  Also, consider that I do not reccomend this game mostly because there is no 'mixed' button for reviews, but the game has a bit too high review score at the moment.  Pros: + More animated story scenes and attempts to present cutscenes\storytelling in new ways, which is commendable, considering what devs have on hands in terms of game engine and resources; + Brand new heroes with brand new abilities, who bring new strategies into the game. They feel fairly balanced and do not seem like some checklist addition; + Survival mode with it's own achivements and therefore challenges and tactics.  Cons: - Obnoxious training challenges, that force you to play in one way and require to meet all winning conditions. Randomness of opponent's type and their starting position add nothing to these challenges, and just force you to fish for better starting conditions by restarting training. One can say that it's an optional content, but you get substantional amounts of Renown for completing these challenges, and if you want to have enough supplies and leveled up heroes to get a lot of achivements — you're left with no other option other than farming these challenges; - Game divides your heroes into two different campaigns after certain point, but you have no control on who ends up in what camp. Depending on your playstyle and preferences, you will feel like one camp has much better heroes than other. You can say that such approach encourages usage of different playstyles which in turn keeps game more entertaining and fresh, but considering that unique challenges for each camp are never seen outside one-two story battles and training challenges — this is not true. - Some moments in story feel underwhelming   for example: laughable reasoning behind Canary's horseborn following Rooks caravan   and unlike first game, BS 2 ends with dumbed-down 'boss' fight, which feels like a cutscene, and then cuts off story without resolving   any   storylines presented in this chapter.",-1,1

316010,Magic Duels,"Well, I'm pretty addicted to mtg, so I was enjoying my time playing despite the crashes, bugs and disconnects. But I'm going to have to find a new game for my relaxation time. The straw that broke the camel's back: I win game, but continue gives me a black screen hang.  I reboot my computer (as this is what I end up having to do eventually each time this happens since force quit doesn't seem to work, and the game leaves my laptop wonky if I can even get rid of the duels process).  When I restart duels, it tells me that there is a mismatch in my local and cloud saved decks, choose one and it will delete the other. No clue what the difference was, so I assume its a case of the cloud save not being up to date and choose local. Oops, my bad.  Apparently the difference was the local had NO DECKS. Now all 11 of my custom decks are gone. The 'customer service' website requires a wizards account login, and my system is lagging to hell because the game is still running, and I'm holding on to my temper by a thread.  To the devs who omitted any safeguards from the process of deleting all your decks: thanks, you guys! Maybe I'll get some work done now that I've deleted the desktop icon!  To other users:  - lots of frustration - seems like not as much mana screw as in previous games (yay?) - horribly annoying default gameplay options (most correctable in gameplay options) - still easy to miss your chance to respond to a spell or stop the timer (how hard would it be to let us check a box so we could always stop at opponent's end of turn?) - very buggy, frequent crashes, black screen hangs and disconnects - runs terribly on my crummy laptop (though most steam games are fine) - deckbuilder was pretty fun - but not so fun I want to recreate all my decks... :(  I give it a 4/10.",-1,0

289200,Ascension to the Throne,"This used to be my favourite game when i was a child. I bought it after beatin Warcraft 3, and loved it a lot. I also replayed it a few times and enjoyed it every time. About a year ago i tried to play Kings bounty, but enjoyed it a lot less than this game. Maybe it's nostalgia, but i really love that in this game every unit is separate, when in KB it's just one unit with the number. It makes it a lot more fun for me. This game may have bad graphics, but does this even matter? It's best part is the fighting system. It's not too long, so i didn't get bored with figths, which are, by the way, pretty different each time. If you played KB, you should know what i'm talking about. In Ascension it also matters how many units you put into one cell. It may be 1 weak soldier, which can be a bait, or a group of them. In the second scenario the group is more likely the distract the enemy, they can even protect more important units with their own bodies, which you couldn't do in KB, but the also can be destroyed by one hit of the wizard, while putting them into separate groups makes it longer to take them all down. The rpg part is not very developed, this is true. There is no skill tree or anything like that. But if you choose to be a wizrd, which is a wise choise, you definatly will enjoy finding new spells, like triple fireballs or distraction. Most of them can be bought learned from wizards in towns, but some, like fast travel spell, are hidden on the map. However, if you want the game to be more challanging, make your hero a warrior and don't learn spells. The world is divided into three continents. The land of humans, the land of orcs and barbariabs and the land of demons. Each of them is full of characters, secrets and side quests. It's really interesting to explore in ths game. If you do, you may find a worthy treasure. Side quests in this game are rather small, but more interesting, than just 'kill-bring' ones. There are such quests as drinking competiton, detective quest. In most of those you can express your will. For example, in the detective quest you can either punish the criminal you find, or take his money + keep him available as a merchant. There are also several items in this game, which cost a lot, A LOT of money. You'll have to complete some side quests in order to buy them. Those are armour, rings etc. Funny thing: you won't be able to buy some items. Merchants will tell you that they are no use for you. They are actually useful for a main caracter of the sequel, which is sadly not on steam. Those items are easter eggs of some sort. I found the plot interesting. The final battle is pretty epic. Plus there are some interestings parts of the main quests, in which you, for example, will have to get rid of all your weapons and armour, your whole army too, and dress as a monk in order to enter a city, taken over by a demon. Hten you'll have to fight him without all things you left behind. If you're a wizard - it's difficult. If you're a warrior - good luck. The in-game journal is done decently. It doesn't say 'kill 10 rats, dragonborn'. The notes in it always fit the atmosphere, and, if you read them, may contain useful hints. I definatly recommend this game.",1,0

The only possible shortcoming is the 100+ USD you have to dump into the game to access all the features, but the amount and diversity of replay it affords you far exceeds the monetary cost.

224820,Super House of Dead Ninjas,"I can see someone putting in dozens of hours trying to unlock everything and beat online high scores in this 2D Snes style Ninja RogueLike game.  I played about 2 hours and beat using a keyboard and still had a decent time but It would be far more fun if I didn't use a keyboard because it is not Gamepad controller ready - you would need third party software to use a controller.  So the basic idea: Go deeper into the tower and collect random power ups/fight random bosses until the bottom. You slowly get stronger the more things you unlock . The first playthrough is the hardest and by my 5th playthrough in under 2 hours I was able to go from the top to the bottom in one game.

427780,PERFECT ANGLE: The puzzle game based on optical illusions,"So, having read the reviews, I went in not expecting much. And was I pleasantly surprised!  The game runs fine, looks pretty and the puzzles are genuinely enticing if somewhat easy once you figure out what you're looking for (I even solved some of them completely at random without realising it!). Controls are mostly fine, I was only kinda confused at the parts where you had to rotate the object instead of going around it yourself as it wasn't very intuitive but I managed. And the water levels look amazing!  Now, the UI part of the game is what mostly disappointed me here. The options menu is weird (as well as the level select). What's wrong with making separate pages for audio/video/controls/other stuff? Or why couldn't they all be on one page? All that scrolling seriously annoyed me. And where is the option to change resolution (and switch to window mode because using Alt+Enter gets boring fast)? One thing that triggers me most in games - the lack of proper window setting.   How am I supposed to follow the guide if I have to switch back and forth?     Not in this case but still    Lighting in some of the rooms was kinda weird - floor suddenly switched from black to white at certain angles.  Also, it's weird that unused hints carry over but their timer does not.  And unskippably being promted to use hints wnen you don't have any is annoying.    All in all, good puzzles, befuddling UI. Overall, I think I enjoyed it. Hope you'll have fun too!",1,0

365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"Optimisation: Even on a 980ti and an i7-5820k this game endures massive stuttering and nearly always crashes upon startup which renders it unplayable. Needless to say, doing a somewhat decent review is also impossible.  Mutliplayer (Dark Zone): It should be noted that the Ubisoft would rather focus on releasing DLC as opposed to implementing an anti cheat system for the Dark Zone in this game. I love finding awesome loot only to get butchered and lose it to a one shot teleporting ♥♥♥.   Multiplayer (overall): Fairly fun to play (with friends that is). Atleast initially. However, after a while you will notice the exact same fetch and grab quests in the exact same buildings with the exact same (only higher level) enemies. As a result of this, I now have a lump in my left breast which I'm fairly certain was caused by this game.   Writing this negative review is probably the best experience I've had with this game.

So yea, then there are the developers, who are wonderful and literally Will respond if you are having problems in-game, or have a suggestion, but due to there fan/player base don't expect for them to answer every little detailed question.  As far as content, there are consistent game updates that have either a newer warframe or weapon/s that are added to the clan dojo/market if that's a thing for you. Lore is now a thing as well. and with that comes gameplay. I personally am a keyboard &amp; mouse kinda guy and i have the Steam controller as well (takes a bit of getting used too) but it is supported as well.  The biggest issue atm is when you start you're limited and to some it feels like there is no true sense of direction, BUT that's the beauty of it all, you can start anywhere your Mastery Rank allows (i will talk about in a second). being in an active clan helps Sooooooo much due to the dojo access and weapons (arguable some of the best non-primed/non-syndicate weapons are located) so realistically you have freedom to expand by completing each planet, leveling up weapons, warframes and earning affinity to rank up your MR (Mastery Rank) and get better. Mastery is a thing that scales your true knowledge in game (and well, what you actually have access too). it is ranked up by earning affinity (this games xp) and when you just think your about to rank up you have... you said it... a rank up test, to some its easy, and to some depending on how far they have progressed in the game, it can get really challenging, each test has it difficulty, from eliminating enemies a certain way to using some tactics (just meaning some are just require your commons sense some require you to use advanced thinking). upon completion, your are granted the next rank up, if failed you wait 24hrs to retake it, but any affinity gained will be counted for your next rank. It is possible to get enough affinity to level the next day you log in after passing a test.

266510,Hand of Fate,"Cool concept; limited entertainment value.  I purchased this game after reading a number of positive reviews because I was intrigued by the concept. I enjoyed playing it for approximately one hour, at which point the novelty wore off. The game became extremely repetitive and offered few, if any, chances for succeeding because of strategy. Combat is a little clunkly and not enjoyable. I found myself getting agitated every time I encountered a combat situation not because it was difficult and I didn't know if I was going to survive, but because I had no desire to endure yet another few minutes of spamming the left mouse button, q key, and space bar.  Quite frankly, there's not much left to say other than after your 60 minutes of enjoyment you will experience a prolonged bout of depression stemming from the money you just wasted on this game.",-1,0

391540,Undertale,"UNDERTALE is by far and without any exaggeration the best game ever made. Everything is perfect from the unbelievably catchy music to the very complex and thrilling storyline that makes you play this game at least a second time. The actual fighting system is the must unique and thoghtful one I have seen so far. The option to spare your opponent makes your actions actually matter, giving LVL and EXP totally new meanings, literally. Depending on which route you´ll choose the games difficulty will also change drastically. If you don´t watch out you    might end up having a reeeally bad time ;).    I own two copies of the game and would make it three if I had money to throw around. I have played the game 5 times now and enjoyed every playthrough because there was always something new and unique to discover. Honestly, I have never felt so invested in a game and its charakters.

24980,Mass Effect 2 (2010),"I'm going to assume that if you're reading this you're not a complete moron and that you took the time to play Mass Effect. If you did play it and you're still reading this that makes me the moron because I don't have to tell you how awesome the sequel is... you already know.  So important and so dangerous is this next mission, if your team has the slightest distraction or any wild, errant thought that isn't directed at shooting the faces off Shepard's enemies, they might be killed without warning by the game's own cinematics. If they aren't committed to the cause, Bioware itself destroys them. As Shepard, you control their fates by making them man it up, or by enforcing their failure through some sort of sickening incompetence.  No matter the outcome, you will play this game again. You can use your own saved games to do it. That way, if you have all your levels and equipment, you won't ♥♥♥♥ it all up next time.",1,0
205100,Dishonored,"You play as Corvo, the bodyguard to the Empress of the Isles.  During your missions you can choose between several ways to reach your goals. There are generally several rutes to your destination, and it can be reach with the help of stealth, abilities susch as possesion or just fighting your way through the forces.   I loved the stealth mechanic in the game and how you could sneak on top of roofs, or by luring your way through timing the routes of the patroling guards. There are also some funn abilities such as possesion and the quest for runes and bone charms are always a fun challenge.   What I didn't like was the fighting, I felt like the fighting scenes weren't as flawless as I'd expected. It sometimes felt like the game didn't obey my commands. But I should aslo point out that I'm not the best fighter in the world, so it might just be me who are rubish. :P  If you like story based games where fighting is not the most important, and you like exploring and planing how to get passed guards without being detected, this is a game for you.",1,0
255710,Cities: Skylines,"What can I say. My 4.5 hours playing isn't long but in that short time it was enough to know this was significantly different than Sim City 5.  I enjoyed Sim City 5 and didn't mind the small maps because so many things would go wrong that I couldn't bare to think of anything on a larger scale. I might just suck.  But diving into this game, its a bit easier where you city will not blow up if you leave things be for a while. It certainly appears as time goes on the difficulty ramps up due to optimizing your traffic, expanding into new areas, etc.   For preferring a casual gameplay and enjoying just seeing my city grow and following people around, this game really makes the mark. With the seemingly unlimited possibilities of getting creative with your city it has quite a bit of replay value if not infinite.  While playing I have still been pondering if its truely better than Sim City 5, graphics, people, cars, buildings, and all...so I decided to play Sim City 5 again... and within 5 minutes a shut it off as it was no contest.   This is absolutely what Sim City should have been and with so many more mods available in such a short time to fix any problem areas you cannot beat this.  Its worth every penny even from starting from a very skeptical point of view. The reviews speak for the game itself.",1,0

I enjoy working in various environments ('workshops') as well. The library is my favorite.  If this software keeps improving over the next year or two, when a 4k headset comes out, productivity will be revolutionized. I would never use my dual monitor setup if this program existed along side a high resolution HMD.  I'd love to see multiple place-able desktops/screens. Let me click and drag my monitors around, resizing them and adjusting their distance using a mouse and scroll wheel. I want a monitor above me streaming netflix, while a small monitor on my left holds the excel file I'm copying and pasting from, and a larger monitor directly center my fov is my main monitor that I'm using. Below me is a small rectangular monitor that's very close, one I'm using for googling as needed.  It's a great, finished program as it is.

277890,Shantae: Risky's Revenge - Director's Cut,Great exploration platform game with tons of soul and style to it. If you are a fan of Metroidvania style games and like the artwork/theme then I can recommend the game for its simple yet fun explorative gameplay.

213670,South Park™: The Stick of Truth™,"Little on the short side of an RPG and you probably need to be a fan of the show.  With that said, I had fun and it was a good experience. Being a fan of South park since the late 90s, I didn't feel the price tag was much of a big deal. Capitalism right?  The game offers very little, almost to none replayability, but it makes up for it with the story. The story is at times intense but a lot of fun. Most of the time it's just pure gross - in the right South Park spirit. It gas a lot of funny refrences both from the show and from the real world.  If you think the pricetag is a little over the hill, wait for a sale - it's woth it.",1,0
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"Okay, so I'm putting this as 'Not Recommended' not because the game is horrible. It's not a horrible game. In fact, it's really fun. It's almost perfect. The problem is, however, the devs, Ubisoft.  This game is beautiful. The graphics are some of the best I've seen. The story's nice and was set up well. The mechanics and gameplay are easy to learn, and it usually never gets repetitive. It definitely deserves and award or two.  The thing that doesn't make it deserve them are the developers, like I said before. Yes, they have addressed some things like game-breaking and frustrating bugs or glitches. However, there are some still left behind. Some of these include: -Falling through the world -Random flying bits of textures flying everywhere -Some I can't even put into words Also, the updates. Yes, only the April update has come out and the May update is dropping soon. But look. The April update gave us Supply Drops, which we all got hyped for. However, when it actually came, we were disappointed. The May update has been confirmed to include 'High-Value Targets', which will hopefully drop better loot than Supply Drops.  So am I saying you should not get this game? No, that's the complete opposite of what I'm saying. Get the game if you want and enjoy the beauty that is The Divison. All I'm telling you is that the only reason why people look down on this game is because of its developers. This game had so much potential when it was shown at E3, and if Ubisoft had taken some steps differently, we could see that potential, and more people would love this game.",-1,0

301300,Chicken Invaders 4,"A great sequel to the franchise. If you have played the previous games, you already know everything about the game. The game has new weapons and unlockable content, obtainable through collecting keys. The unlockables range from purely cosmetic effects to adding a few addition atack types. This gives the game some replayability. This installment of the franchise also features online multiplayers, as previous only had local co-op.  But unfortunately, atleast for me, not enough has been changed from it's predecessors. If you have played previous titles before, you will get bored pretty quickly as the gameplay is identical most of the time. Also the game is pretty easy, which hurts the replay value. The game also does not have many achivements or challenges to test your skill and keep you interested. The only thing I have found to make the game harder is playing with a keyboard instead of a mouse, since keyboards lack the speed and precision mice offer, but that makes it less enjoyable.   In conclusion, for the price they have given the game is worth picking up, although I would love to see the franchise steer in the Rouge-like/Rouge-lite/PDS genre, with RPG elements. Personally I feel that the game will benefit a lot from the added depth from the PDS and RPG, which will make it a lot more interesting as well as add a lot of replayability.",1,0

241930,Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™,"I hate to post a negative review for this game because it's really fun, but for a AAA game that digs its heels into the Tolkien universe, things must be said.  Pros -You kill orcs. Lots of orcs. -Aesthetics are phenomenal, especially the environment lighting as well as the physics engines. -Strong combat mechanics.  Cons -After killing orcs for 20+ hours, orc killing gets boring. -The story is sort of short and doesn't really take advantage of the Tolkien universe. -Was looking forward to an epic boss fight at the end, what. the. hell. happened. to. my. boss. fight. -It takes the entire length of the game to expand your skill tree, but once the game is over there's absolutely 0 replay value. -The whole wraith concept still confuses me.  All in all, the combat system is a dramatic improvement on all the other 3rd person twitch reflex combat systems with a pretty awesome integrated snapshot mechanic for all your orc decapitations, plus the combat pacing has a sort of action comic vibe going on. But mostly, I was kind of disappointed. For a LOTR game, to be stuck in Udun and another location that was just Udun with grass was a huge let down, especially considering the epic locations mentioned in the books and seen in the movies. Also, the revenge plot was a little dry and unoriginal, plus the fact that Talion looks like the Punisher isn't really helping in the originality department. If Monolith had gone with making Lithariel the main character, that would have been so much more interesting, then the entire motivation would have shifted from a futile revenge story to Lithariel protecting her homeland.  I'm sincerely rooting for Monolith and the new direction their taking with game development; they have a strong combat system, but the underlying story wasn't strong enough to support the rest of the game. Just my perspective, hope this helps you decide whether or not to buy it.",-1,0

Or, more often than not, go on a frenzied panic-fuelled run through the level as you try to lose the angry pursuers. And this is the real strength of the game - having your elaborate (or not, as the case may be) plan fall to pieces does not mean it's time to restart. It means it's time to think on your feet.

233450,Prison Architect,"Prison Architect is the game that proves that you don't need flashy 3D graphics to have a great game. The 2D visuals are still attractive nonetheless. The only graphic deawback is the people but if you can look past that, you're in for a treat.    Let's start by saying that good prison games are hard to find. and this one is the best prison simulator we will have for the next 10 years and here's why...   The detail of building your prison is immense. You can design and build everything from a dormitory detention center to a full blown supermax prison complete with death row (yes, there is an electric chair). You can even build female prisons! Some women come complete with babies and need places to care for them.   After you get the prison constructed enough to begin housing prisoners, you then dive into running the place. This is where the real fun begins. You'll manage food distribution, finances, the daily schedule, reform programs, drug addicted losers, staff, guards, what offences get what penalties, the list goes on and on. That's not all, there is a full weather system so you'll need to supply heat to your prison or your inmates will complain about being cold. Find and confiscate contraband from cigarettes and booze to weapons and escape tools. These people will smuggle in all sorts of stuff from the visitation room from mom and dad to their buddy throwing drugs over the yard wall! Got a prisoner doing time in solitary for getting caught with a knife? see if he is willing to be a confidential informant in exchange for his release from solitary (not the prison). Now he will sing like a bird and tell you who is carry what contraband (that he knows of). He'll tell you if he knows of an upcoming trade or drug deal. He'll fill you in on when a drop over the wall was arranged or if Joe Smith has a tunnel started under his toilet!    Best of all are gangs! The confidential informant will also tell you who are gang members and gand leaders (that they know of). They'll tell you who is strong, volitile, fearless, etc. Gangs will take over territory in your prison. The red gang might have control over the yard and the blue gang grabbed the common room. The gangs will extort money from regular prisoners to use the room's facilities. (Charge an inmate to use the weights in the yard for example.) You must stop these gangs from taking over your prison! Deploy guards, armed guards, K-9 dog handlers to take back territory. The K-9 can sniff out drugs as well as find tunnels.    This is so much more than a building game. The designing and building is very fun but the real fun begins when you get a lot of prisoners and especially if you have gangs enabled and they begin taking over parts of your precious creation! Once you get your prison escape proof, load it up in 'Escape Mode' and be a prisoner yourself! That's right, you can be a prisoner in your own prison! Now you can test just how easy (or hard) your prison is to get out of. Recruit a team of buddies, get in fights, smuggle a weapon from the workshop, dig under your cell to find freedom!    There are loads of mods in the Steam Workshop that make this game even better. There are graphic mods that remove the 'cartoon' look of the game and add more 'HD' looks to it. There are mods that completely add new reform programs, objects, building materials, people and staff, etc, etc.. The game is very British, which is ok. But there are mods for other languages as well as American terminology.   The developers are finished adding new content and will be tying everything up in a few months with a completed, bug-free version, or so they say. So the game is near completion. The best prison simulator on the market, hands down. If you own any (or all) of the Prison Tycoon games, they have been executed and will rest in peace. Throw them all away and buy Prison Architect right now. You will not be disappointed!",1,0

438270,Learn Japanese To Survive - Hiragana Battle,"Theoretically, while using this game, I am meant to be learning Japanese and having fun. I am learning some Japanese. I am  not  having fun.  The lesson sets are fair educational material, with voice clips and tips on writing the hiragana, which are welcome enhancements. The music is fairly good. As a game, however, Hiragana Battle combines the worst missteps of the JRPG genre into a single frustrating experience. Gameplay is clunky and slow, made up of grindy battles in which every attack can take upwards of half a dozen key strokes. You can also use the mouse, but the game isn't well-geared to that either, and you have to click on the hiragana in the tiny menus instead where they loom large on the battle screen.  Drilling the Hiragana by selecting (or better, typing) matching English syllables is a fine thought for practicing them, but every element of the interface seems designed to take as long as possible to navigate and use. Or more likely, they were the default settings of a sort of JRPG-maker program that the devs didn't bother to find a way to improve, despite the fact that they cripple the experience by inserting pointless user-unfriendliness into everything.  Quests and story progression are not special, except that they also are laden with pointless, time-consuming delays and lazy design. Obstacles appear and disappear without explanation to railroad you through puzzles and the game takes up even more of your time with unskippable dialogue and cutscenes designed to show and tell you everything obvious so that you don't get a chance to explore anything on your own. For example, there is a quest to fix the broken bridge (of course) with three nearby logs. You will know where to find them without needing to explore because if you so much as approach the bridge, for the first, second, or twentieth time, your guide NPC will helpfully and vocally wish that you had some materials to fix it with, and you get to watch the camera slowly pan over to where the logs you need to go get are, and then slowly pan back. Then when you pick them up, you are treated to an identical dialogue pop-up congratulating you on finding each individual log, despite the fact that they are right next to one another.  There is no way to skip or quicken the repetitive animations, cutscenes and dialogue boxes that quickly become extremely tiresome. There is, however, a hotkey to quit to menu without confirmation and without saving, so you can lose all your session's progress with the press, even the accidental press, of a single button.

202970,Call of Duty: Black Ops II,"This game is BY FAR one of the best Call of Duties for PC EVER!!! This game is one of the best optimized ports released. No lag or fps drops at ALL. Holds a steady frame rate above 60+ with my ASUS GTX 760. This game is just so well made, If only Infinity ward/Sledgehammer could take notes from Treyarch on how to optomize a game for pc. The little details, such as using the period key to change custom classes is great, and its very nice including a stupid simple fov slider. The gameplay is so well designed. I could not recommend this more if you are looking for a good CoD to play on pc. Best to buy on sale but I would seriously consider the $59.99 price tag on it (Come on the game is 3 freaking years old, at least lower it to 40 or 30$) the biggest issue, but I would still get it for that.",1,0

474750,Reigns,"EDIT: I'm doing a proper review now, the old one is below for posterity.  Reigns is Kings and Castles meets Cards and Calamaties but I'll leave the rest for the review and the time starts now.  Reigns plays extremely simply. You pick an option by chosing the left or the right when the card comes up. Like Tinder but instead of setting up a date you're managing a kingdom and you have four factions, The Church, the People, the Army and the Merchants, that you have to manage. They get too low? The people will riot and the merchants buy out your kingdom? They get to high? The pope takes over your kingdom so leave them in the middle alright?  Each option will have an effect, it could be to change the metersor it could be to unlock something for the future playthroughs becuase you will be playing through as more than one king. If you've played Rogue Legacy you'll be used to the idea of generations and that's what you have here. You can unlock buildings that might help in a famine or unlock new people that will give you access to new cards and situations. The game is cheap, it's fun and it's addictive. Give it a shot and you won't be dissapointed, or at least I wasn't.    Original short review: I don't know what to say. This game is great. It's so simple but it's so fun. I can not reccommend this highly enough!",1,0

Using insert, delete home and end to change between sections of the menu? The feeling of TLC is there, but not enough. Could've at least try a bit harder on the port. I rather play TLC with mods again if there aren't any changes to the interface. Why would you remove mouse from a menu on a bloody PC game. It makes no sense, unless its just a lazy port just to milk money from a series that a lot of people love. Way to disappoint us again Lionhead.

211820,Starbound,"Starbound is a game full of intrigue. The gameplay's teired armor system adds for a nice goal and end game, though it does make the gameplay feel flat after having achived the last teir. BUT thankfully this is not what make the game fun or great, the constant novelty and interesting mechanics is what makes it playable for hours on end. Since the release the development of the story has also given purpose to 'why am I here doing this' and makes for a great challenge. The story helps bring you into a curious state about all the races, each one design with there own culture and querks. The races all feel like they could exist in this strange reality, and It's not uncommon you might find yourself with a strong strong affinty to one or another race. Finding Strutures that feel they should have some story behind it or codex fill in the blanks of these beings lives. Wether you go in taking everything and buring it all down, or go in with olive branches and yellow quest marks, the dynamic of the races and their works is what makes this game. Then it all ties in when you can create a colony of you own, then bring them on your ship and explore some more. All in all a great game, which hold a lot of potential for entertianing gameplay.",1,0

This is SR in it's golden age before it went bananas with SR3 and 4. The game has a good story and excellent characters.  SR has often been viewed as GTA's little brother. I think SR:2 is simular to GTA, but less serious and more focused on fun. The game is now cheap, and regulary on sale. I would recommend anyone to pick it up.

I got up to bout 50 hours of gameplay total on it b4 I got tired of the game.     Once I had a working strategy, the game became too easy tho. The unlocks help a lot with those (dual sunflower, quad peashooter, and upgrading spikeplants to counter the carts destroying them). The trick to make mucha money is playing to get plants, grow 'm full, and sell them for 8000 or more, buy 3 marigold plants from dave, grow 'm up, and keep day garden full of plants. Use the snail to collect coins, it stays collecting for about an hour after getting chocolate, so you can let it idle, Just sell couple expensive dropped plants at a time, and buy new from the shop.",1,0

Excellent bosses, interesting puzzles and the desing is awesome.   To be honest even thought I recomend the game, Cave Story was released as a free game by a Japanesse guy called Pixel. Cave Story+ is no more than the commercial version of it... new sounds electronic sounds (you can choose to listen to the original ones too, those are quite nice), textures polished a bit, a few modes such as time-run as well as some minigames...but thats it.

265930,Goat Simulator,"Goat Simulator was a good game when I played on Mac. Now, for me to consider to redownload it or not, I would pick no.   Mac has been known to be a bad system to play games on, yet my Mac can play most of the Valve games and some third-party games, like this one. Now I play mostly on Windows now, I said no to downloading this again.  Firstly, this game is riddled with glitches. This is a complete game, not Early Access. I guess it is supposed to make the game funnier.   Which leads to my second point. This game tries very hard to be funny. It just simply is not. It relies heavily on pop culture references and puns for jokes which are very poor and unfunny.  The physics in this game are absolutely horrific. When people get hit by cars, they lie there for a second, and get back up like nothing ever happened. Same with the goat. People get stuck in walls, the goats head flaps wildly, heads extend towards the sky, the tongue of the goat shoots into outer space for no reason at all, and everything explodes and shoots everywhere with one single tap. Also, if benches are pushed away, people float in the air.  The community is the only saving grace, EXCEPT I COULD NOT DOWNLOAD ANYTHING!  Finally, the graphics. These graphics are good, very good, IF THIS WAS RELEASED IN 2004! Textures look murky, the goat looks like an early PS3 model, and people look unpolished. This looks like a PS2 game.  Forgot to mention the fireworks. No control over them, they will just shoot you off in a random direction.  Achievements were the worst. Relied on pop culture references, but at least POSTAL 2 did it right, and that was from 2003!   A Goat Simulator plush was not needed.  Music is just a looped synth beat that gets annoying after at least 10 minutes.  I was bored with this game after at least 10 minutes.  If you want it, get it on sale for dirt cheap. Whatever you do, avoid this game at all costs on regular price.  3 out of 10",-1,0

Shadow Tactics is a pitch perfect homage to the gameplay I loved in those games, but still manages to find its own voice and style to set it apart.

234190,Receiver,"Whether your looking for a realistic Indie FPS, a fun and exciting new twist on first-person shooters, or a realistic gun simulator with a classic arcade feel, there is something for everybody in a game that can be fun but rather burdensome oftentimes.  The game features realistic gun errors, (i.e jamming, safe reloads, and bullets getting stuck in the cylinder) excellent gun mechanics, and awesome bullet physics. The game while fun, has some major performance issues. I will often be on an important part of the game when suddenly I start to get major lag. This should not be happening on a game like this, as the graphics are not even that good. This takes away from much of the game's fun. When the game is not lagging (something which is a rare commodity) it is extremely fun to play. When you encounter a flying mind tech you feel this true sense of fear for your life as you either fight or run. Shooting and reloading the gun is rather interesting because every single part of the gun is controllable. While this adds uniqueness to the game it slows the pace down considerably and has nothing to help speed it up.  The verdict: An exciting and adrenaline pumping experiment that is hindered majorly by its massive performance issues. While the game is fun to play it badly needs to be optimized. If you have beast gaming computer or something 'good enough' to run most games, then I would definitely recommend picking this up!

I nice change from the usual mmo style gameplay, still rigid in some parts (blocking still seems buggy and rolling/dodging is awkward, i have special powers and can fly but i can only roll once per 1.5 seconds....) The free-to-play is incredibly done, just what youd expect little nickle and diming here with reasonable purchases to unlock more content permanently. but with the SOE all access comng soon, Why wouldnt you subrscribe, 500 station cash each month, and access to other great games like planet side 2, Dragons prophet. back to DC. endgame level is 30, which lets you get to the good stuff faster than other games. shared bank space between your characters, so you can just trade it instead of mailing. Its no City of heroes/villains, but its a healthier choice on your wallet rather than champions online. Lots of active players, its never too quiet. pve and pvp server available, which you can just swap between almost anytime (with a cooldown involved) with the heroes vs villains scenario, pvp server should be the way to go. fun when a group of 15's overtake a cocky 30. worth giving it a shot on the f2p format, lotta restrictions but still a very entertaining game.",1,0

367000,Fine Sweeper,"At it's base it's a polished version of Minesweeper with progression to feed gratification and lives to continue playing if you make a small hiccup.  Unfortunately, there are some negatives which I hope will be patched in at a later date, these would include:  First click not being an island--This is a fairly basic mechanic featured on some of the more simpler versions of Minesweeper found on the web. Not sure why this wasn't included from the start, since otherwise you are taking random guesses and unfairly losing lives (albeit there are some situations you have to guess no matter what, but the first click shouldn't be it).  When you set off a bomb it changes the numbers around the explosion--When this first happened and a 2 changed to a 1, I didn't realise and thought 'Oh, so the bomb went off on the one so I'll free these other spaces around the 1' and then set off another bomb. Maybe some people prefer this but I feel like it's misleading and completely interrupts my flow and I have to re-read the board to make sure the numbers that may have changed don't have the appropriate amount of flags already.  Along with this, when a bomb explodes, the numbers underneath are barely readable. As well as numbers underneath heart pickups, and the very font to be honest is a bit poor. I would much prefer a clear-cut font like the font used to display the amount of bombs left on the map to be used, perhaps it can be a customisable option or something.  The Game Over screen completely covers the board when you die, which is frustrating because you can't see your mistake and learn from it.   And finally, I looked at the 'things to come' screenshot quickly from the Dev (couldn't find a list of things he's patching otherwise I might have left some things off this list if he's patching them) but the colour contrast on the new colours for numbers looks quite poor and hard to read on darker levels--while not officially a thing that can be reviewed right now since it's not even in the game, I thought on the off-chance the dev reads this he can brighten up the colours for the numbers a bit.  Criticism aside, it's a nice looking iteration of Minesweeper and £1.59 isn't much to pay for a game which you can easily lose 30 mins or so of your day every time you load it, which adds up if you pace yourself. I would recommend, and I hope the dev updates it to become even more polished.  I would love to see more illustrations from the artist featured in the game some how too, they are quite lovely.",1,0

314020,Morphopolis,"Very pretty but it doesn't work right. I think they should check to see if the game is going to work on a desktop with Vista before they put a game up for sale. Designers might also consider putting in an auto solve button where a player can just watch the computer put the petals of the flower in place. As it is I tried the first flower puzzle and wasn't sure the game was working right. Moving the caterpillar along the branch didn't work right. I couldn't get the petals to go where I needed them so I assume there's something wrong with the flower puzzle. I have a bunch of other games with horrible, awkward controls so why would a designer think I wanted to spend a lot of time fiddling and researching how to do the simplest thing with a 25 cent game? Just put in an auto solve button and let me use that. If I want to do it myself I promise I won't use the auto solve. Either that or make sure your game works right and has some adequate text to explain how to get things done.",-1,0

20900,The Witcher: Enhanced Edition,"The game seems to be pretty long: I have been doing all the side quests and, 15 hours into the game, I'm still somewhere in Chapter II.  The combat system is quite interesting: the use of combat styles and time-based clicks brings the game beyond a simple 'hack and slash'. However, the tutorial (i.e. the Prologue Chapter) does a poor job at explaining how it works, so it takes some experimentation.  Still about the Prologue: the first scenarios might give you the wrong impression, as they are relatively empty, given the size of the map and the number of enemies and objects you can interact with. just ignore the feeling, and wait until Chapter I, when things get better.  Alchemy (brewing potions, creating oils and crafting bombs) and its companion profession - herbalism - give also some variety to combat and traveling.  The dialogues are pretty simple: various sources explain this fact with the translation costs from Polish to English. Still enjoyable.  Last but not least, the sexual encounters. There has been a lot of debating about this topic, ranging from the censorship of the 'love cards' (AFAICT, the Steam version is not censored), to whether this mechanic is out of place in this game. In any case, most of those encounters are optional, so you do not need to engage in them if you feel uncomfortable, and they don't go beyond displaying, for a few seconds, a pencil drawing featuring a scantly dressed female character.  My final impression is definitely positive, and I would recommend this game to a friend.",1,0

I played GTA a loooong time ago on PSP (Liberty City and Vice City editions) and I didn't really pay too much attention to the stories. But this one though, is way more captative. It gives you some strong emotions and makes you want to play more and more.  In my opinion, if you are planning on buying a violent but interesting game, this is your choice. You can either be super violent or be smart. The best parts are the Heists, where you can choose between a radical aproach or a smarter and more creative one.  I haven't played GTA V online nor I plan on doing it while I'm playing the story mode. If you want to buy GTA V only for online, then don't.

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"*Note: This review is for the SP campaign only.  Treyarch has finally jumped the shark. The campaign of the Black Ops series started out based with a somewhat historical-based storyline, and now...I have no idea what happened. It's this non-sensical, ghost-in-the-machine, too-near-future-to-be-even-close-to-being-possible-made-up-bulls**t. I can't wrap my mind around all the chaos and destruction going on in this game, it's just certifiably insane...it actually reminds me of if Spec Ops: The Line, and Bioshock had a love child.  That being said, it was quite enjoyable once I got used to the extra controls that are needed for the mind powers. (The first hour is a tutorial just to familiarize you with them...then they take them all away and you have to spend points to unlock them as you play). The length is pretty decent for a COD SP campaign too, and it wouldn't be out of the question to play through it again on a higher difficulty, since you can't unlock all the abilities in the first playthrough, and there are 2 other sets of abilities I didn't even try yet, not to mention you keep all the ones you already unlocked on the next play.  So, anyway, it was pretty good. I don't normally do many reviews, but seeing as how I didn't really like it at first, and then I ended up really enjoying it, I just had to write this up.",1,0

Harder then the original Hexcells, lots of fun, and an extra information piece with the blue cells sometimes having a number counting other blue cells within the 18 cells around it in a circle.

Simple idea, but because you need to use 2 or 3 levels of counter-logic to complete certain sections of some puzzles, with the extra information piece, and harder puzzles, this was a great sequel to the original. I got about 3 times as much time out of Plus going for the perfectionist achievement as I did with the original.",1,0
272060,Serena,"This game is nice and short, and has a pretty good story. (Not a bedtime story though. No no no no -NO-. Don't make the mistake I made of playing it right before I had been intending to go to bed. Going to bed after playing this little gem wouldn't work out very well). I did notice that there are three phases and I'm pretty sure you have to get each and every little snippet out of each and every object to trigger the switches between phases. I did get kind of lost on occasion because I didn't create a set order to go through the objects in for myself, so sometimes I was left searching around for that one item I didn't examine during that phase. I'll give a small hint about how to handle the phases without spoiling anything.  Phase 1, you know you've got all the unique snippets you're gonna get from an object when you start getting said unique snippets repeated from that object, which is your cue to move on to the next object.  Phase 2, there's one common dialog set across all items once you've gotten all unique snippets from the particular object, so (after you figure out what the common set is) when a phrase from that common set is used, get moving to the next object. (There is one object that has a unique phrase -very- similar in nature to the common phrase set, however the wording is not 100% the same as the common set version so keep clicking if you think something's off).  Phase 3, once you've gotten all the unique phrases you're gonna get from an object, you won't be able to examine it anymore. Arguably makes this phase the easiest to navigate. Do be sure to avoid accidentally double-clicking or clicking again before he's finished speaking though- you won't get that dialog back without playing a second time through. (I guess that goes for phase 2 as well).  For the whole thing, I would try to go clockwise around the room (or whatever set pattern works for you). Try to really be sure there's nothing left to examine from your current standing point before switching to another standing point. Each new phase does open up some new things to examine, so you'll have to be sure again at every standing point every new phase. Don't just charge through the same things you examined in previous phases during new phases or you'll likely miss a lot of the (fairly good) story and possibly even get stuck.  I find the story's good point isn't so much the originality of the scenario, but the main character's reactions to his memories, realizations, and emotions. I'll admit the scenario itself is likely somewhat of a common one, however there are plenty of stories out there that are good more for their characters then their scenario. This is most definitely one of them, in spite of only having two characters (and only one that you ever actually 'see'). (Again though, for your own sake, please don't play this right before the time you're planning to go to bed. It's tagged as 'dark' for a darn good reason. Any other time of day is 100% fine and even recommended). Short and sweet story.  Even if you don't end up enjoying it quite as much as I did, it only takes ~1 hour (maybe less) to play through, not a terrible amount of time, and it's free, so you've got absolutely nothing what-so-ever to lose from giving it whirl. Give it a try, you'll probably like it, and even if you don't then oh well- you didn't really lose anything.",1,0

242920,Banished,"Nice game in the footsteps on Settlers. In fact I think this game takes the good parts from Settlers (building, resource manipulation, expansion) and leaves the bad ones (combat) behind. That being said, without any opposition the game is perhaps too easy. Once you figure out how to do production chains efficiently you are set. And in this game the chains are very short and simple.  One game mechanic that was interesting are the visiting merchants that you can buy seed or breeding stock from, allowing you to cultivate new crops and breed new animals. Nice touch but it all just comes down to 'food' with couple exceptions (wool, leather).  Another nice game mechanic is the way human procreation is set up. I won't spoil the discovery for you but it is quite possible to lose a game because your population is not viable anymore.  Nice game but it needs more complexity.",1,0

270310,Dominique Pamplemousse,"A okay game, has no widescreen, didn't really bother me, but can be buggy at times when saving and exiting. but also, very good music, and a great taste for younger children. Not a very long game, I beat it my self in an hour and thirty minutes, which is a bit, but not very long. Afterall, for 5 dollars compaired to The Order of 1886 (i think thats what it's called. I never paid too much attention) which only lasts for 5 hours, this game is good and I would reccommend it to anyone who has some spare money in intention of having a giggle here and there, but it plays best on non widescreen. there is no options, so there is no way to fix it unless they create a patch, and the entire game is flash based, which is okay, but not the greatest game option, it runs perfectly fine on older computers, but if you don't like games that have large and quite annoying cutscenes sometimes (outresgeously out of key singing) then I wouldn't reccommend it. Any other way though, I would. Anyone who likes HD, this game is not for you. Anyone who likes an option screen to entitle the game to your own likings, this game is not for you, but if you don't really care at all about these things, I wouldn't even bother not buying this game. It is a great 'semi' time waster, and doesn't take that long to beat. for 5 dollars, I would reccommend this game to anyone who doesn't care about what I've referenced above.",1,0

219830,King Arthur's Gold,"So the gameplay is fantastic. It's original, incredibly fun, and it has a small but devouted fanbase.   But this is the most glitch filled mess that has ever existed. Making the game run is comparable to domesticating a shark.   The game ran fine the first day.  On the second day it refused to get past the launcher. Support, while they tried to help, ultimately didn't do anything.   On the third game it ran fine, but I had to restart multiple times to get the game to use my Steam name.   Oh yes, one more thing, I'd say close to half of those three hours I've played are me trying to make the game actually run.   On the fourth day, or perhaps the third day because they are honestly all blending together, the game crashed when joining a game. I updated my drivers today, or yesterday, I don't even know, and the game crashed while loading up the server list.  It also failed to recognize my Steam name again.   I must have reinstalled this game 20 times in the last few days.   This is all such a shame, I really wanted to love and like this game but if I can't even get it to run how could I possibly reccomend it?",-1,0

237740,Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures,"It's good, worth a couple dollars no more. I've been watching AVGN for a long time now, and this game is very suiting. But don't pay too much; to won't be worth your investment. Catch this game on sale if you can. This is the short answer. If you want to know more read on.  The good:  The controls are good, though definitely use a controller. A keyboard has felt clumsy for me and the developers definitely had using a playstation or xbox controller in mind.   The story is VERY AVGN. It's a bit of fun and makes it worth playing for a while. If you've watched AVGN a lot, you'll see a lot of references to his videos throughout the game. The humor is funny for a little while, but it gets a bit tiresome.   The music is great. Every stage has different theme and it's some of the best 8-bit music out there. The sound effects make it sound like your zapper or sound waves are really inflicting quite a bit of damage on the enemies you hit. These are great compliments to the game.  The difficulty is quite hard, but once you get used to the controls, you'll be blaming yourself rather than the game for deaths. The first few stages aren't terribly difficult in comparison with the later stages (they'll give you a run for your money though), but the later ones aren't nearly so easy. More on that later.  I haven't had any major gripes with the types of enemies.  The eh:  The stages get very repetitive and by the end, you don't feel like you're really playing a different stage with completely new enemies. Most of the enemies are reskins from other levels. For example, the fireballs, the happy faces, the flying ghosts, the squids are all the same, just different shapes. These are the most common enemies, and you can't even kill them. Furthermore, there aren't enough enemies for the diversity of weapons. So many times have I wanted to slaughter a band of enemies with my light saber but rarely do any come. And the ones that do come are so difficult to hit, it's easier to just avoid them than to risk getting hurt by one.  The extra characters are cool, but they're usually impractical to use. The guitar guy has a better weapon, but he can't aim it and he can't jump as high as the Nerd. It's too bad there aren't quite that many enemies that can be killed. Mike jumps higher than the nerd, but he's a bit clumsier and his weapon isn't nearly as good as either of the others (kind of like Luigi in the recent 3D Marios). The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t man gets a special second jump, but even with both jumps he still can't jump higher than the Nerd. His weapon sucks, don't use it. There aren't really any points in the game where you realize you HAVE to use another character. It's a shame because this could have been a real good opportunity for a bit of a puzzle design.  Powerups are in the game, but they're too scant to be useful. Plus sometimes they don't even do anything good anyway! The glitch gremlin will stop all enemy movement, but what good does it do if you have standstill ghosts everywhere and there's no way to jump over them all? It's impossible to freeze them at the perfect time.  The later stages are just tedious. Multiple obstacles face you in every direction and the game isn't even fair for most of them. For example, the haunted stage involves moving platforms that you have to keep up with. But if you haven't played that part of the stage before, you're bound to fall off because of the unpredictable motions of the platform. I understand a couple deaths to this, but the coupling of the platforms, enemies, and those wretched death blocks make the game outright frustrating.  In fact, my biggest gripe has got to be the death blocks. The death blocks are everywhere and they don't add to the game experience. If you touch them, you'll die instantaenously; it doesn't matter how many beers you have left. With so many in the game, you will come to realize that there's no reason to avoid the other flying enemies since your main obstacle are those death blocks. The death blocks are strategically placed in stupid locations designed to make you die and start all over again. They just seem like cheap deaths. With so many death blocks around, it's nearly impossible to beat the game on normal difficulty, let alone hard.  The humor feels much much darker than the Nerd is in his videos. Maybe it's the open-mouthed shock-face that James instills in his character every time something goes horribly wrong that the game developers didn't manage to recreate in-game. The nerd starts dissing the game too early and never stops.  Conclusion:  If you're a fan of the Nerd, get this game under one condition: don't buy this game for more than $7! The game gets a couple things perfectly right but then forgets or gets too lazy to change it up. If the developers didn't want to spend the extra time to program new and intuitive enemies, better levels, and more exciting uses of your teammates, you shouldn't pay the extra money to buy this game.",1,0

237990,The Banner Saga,"Pros: Gameplay seemed to combine the games Shining Force and Oregon Trail in a way that totally works. Rich artwork. Absolutely beautiful music. Emotionally engaging with characters you grow to love and hate.... very casually funny at moments. The world and story seem realistic enough to grab interest... and unexplained enough to make you wonder. Replayable (but also almost manditory needs to be replayed, see Cons) as the choices made effect the story enough to give different experiences each time through.  Cons: The layout of the final boss fight. It forces you to use characters you may have not leveled. Some characters that you sink resources into can up and leave if you make certain decisions. The final boss fight is the only hard fail check in the game such that you can get by the whole game and get to the end with an unwinnable fight ahead of you. would have liked to see a little more variation in the types of battles. once beating the game, there are a couple of things left unwrapped up.",1,0

At first, I was trying to follow a tutorial for beginners, then that guy started to stray into places I couldn't follow. Mostly because the characters were different, I think. Anyway, it started to go wrong when I kept trying to do what he did and then I'm running around my courtyard....  -----------------  'What's a vassal?!? You! I'm your.... lie-guh. What's a vassal??'  'You mean, liege, your liege?'  'Whatever! Something is wrong with my town, I booted out the bishop and now some guy off the street wandered in and is trying to run it. He's ruining my town!'  'Ahh, the bishopric you mean?'  'Whatever! You! You look somewhat holy-ish, c'mere.'  'Sir?'  'Here, does this hat fit?'  'It does sir, who shall I deliver it to?'  'Nobody, you're now the bishop.'  'But, but... sir, but sir...''  'No buts, get to work!'  'Okay, I'm an old man and I got to get married, hand me that book, I'll pick somebody and I'll... and my son too, I need and hair and so will he. We'll start a big family. Okay, here we go, a couple of comely lasses from a large kingdom, I'll ask for their hand in marriage, we'll have a grand wedding! You, send this off by carrier pidgeon or catapulted peasant or whatever you use for communications!'  'Right away, sir! Wait, you should look at this before....'  'Are you telling me, of all people, that you are disobeying me? Right here in front of all my subjects?'  'No sir... I'll.... your liege, please forgive me.'  A WHILE LATER...  'Sir, we have recieved word that your marriages are both agreed upon, congratulations!'  'Excellent! We'll prepare the wedding now! A feast! A party! We'll.... why are you looking at me like that?'  'Well, sir, your wife to be and daughter in law. Your lady is only 4 years old, and your son's lady is only 2.'  'Oh jesus... jesus hell... what the... why didn't anybody tell me!'  And all that was in the first couple hours. I'm an idiot. My dude is broke and in the middle of a war. Lots of people in my court hate my face. My one plot to try and end the war isn't going well, the old bugger just won't die of 'natural causes'.  All in all, it's just going to get worse for me and I can't wait, it's a blast.

I can run the game with every graphic option set to the very maximum and have about 100fps with my GTX 660ti. It means you can run the game well even if you have an older graphic card.

289070,Sid Meier's Civilization VI,"If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding cheese cake recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients:  1 cup digestive plain sweet biscuit crumbs 3 tablespoons sugar 3 tablespoons melted butter 40 ounces softened cream cheese 1 cup sugar 3 tablespoons flour 1 tablespoon vanilla 1 cup sour cream 4 eggs  Directions: For The base:. If you're using a dark pan, preheat the oven to 350. If you are using a shiny pan, 375. Combine the crumbs, melted butter and 3 tbsp sugar well and pat onto the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan. I also like to very very lightly butter the sides of the pan so that the cheesecake will not stick later on. Bake for 10 mins in your preheated oven and remove. Let it cool while you prepare your batter. For the batter:. Make sure everything is at room temperature. Combine sugar, cheese, flour and vanilla in a big bowl and mix on medium speed till well combined. Don't forget to scrape the bowl as you're doing this. Mix in the sour cream till its incorporated well. Then, add the eggs one by one, mixing well after each addition. Pour the batter into the springform and let it bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes After the baking time, turn off the oven and leave the door ajar. Let the cake cool in there for about 1 1/2 hours. Remove the cake and let it cool thoroughly. Refrigerate overnight. Release the sides of the springform. Eat.  (HOWEVER) For the review, I love the game and all the changes... BUT I do not like fact that THERE IS NO FKN EARTH MAP WTF -_-",1,1

296970,Renowned Explorers: International Society,"This is a great game. I see it's on sale, if you don't have it and you're considering getting it do so. If you like turn-based combat or boardgames then you should be right at home. The game has a humorous, upbeat style and likeable charactes. Interactions are all text based, there isn't really anything grim or dark if that's your thing, but it's a good time and mixing and matching your crew of adventurers while devising new strategies is a lot of fun. To me at least.   I saw this game was on sale, I had previously played it and liked it enough that I thought I should give it a recommendation for anyone on the fence. It plays a lot like a board game, with rpg and strategy elements. You pick a crew of three adventurers (who all have their own personalities, perks and skills that will help in various challenges), you travel around an adventure board, encountering combat and dialogue challenges, leveling your characters up, collecting treasures and moving on to the next adventure which you pick from a world map.   Between adventures you return to the Society headquarters where you can buy various specialists that either grant a benefit or make the game play slightly differently and place research points into a civilization like tech tree that does the same. You can also buy items for your characters here that do everything from simply adding attack and armor to adding new perks and skills. There are a lot of different ways to win the game, and there's dice rolls on everything that you can weigh in your favor with specialities, treasures and craftable/salvageable toolkits.   The devs are still supporting the game with new content and tweaks so things are still changing all the time. If any of this appeals to you, you might like renowned explorers. I recommend the game and you can easily find out within the return period if it's for you so what's stopping you, try it!",1,0

238960,Path of Exile,"Path of Exile is a game that brings together what made Diablo such a game. The world is very well designed and very immersive. The game is also a great MMO all-together. It emphasizes co-op and makes it so it is near possible to play without a group of people, but I mean if you're going to play an MMo, what are you doing playing by yourself? While I find the world very immersive, the story is a bit on the downside. It is pretty bland and it makes you feel as if you're doing errands more than unraveling an epic adventure. One thing to remember that this game is almost completely free-to-play, besides some small micro-transactions that don'y have much of the game whatsoever. I like this because most free-to-play games throw you in and try to persuade you almost to the point of insanity to buy stuff. The only small part is the micro-transactions are pretty expensive. I mean, come on! I'm not going to spend $15 for a small pet or a chest for my guild to put stuff in! Overall, this game has a very immersive world with a lot of fun combat tactics and enemies which brought back some nostalgia from the Diablo II days, but the story falls a bit short. So, if you're looking for a good MMO to play with some friends on a long weekend, this is the 1st game I'd to you!",1,0
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Actually really rate this game. It is a great progression of the total war series into a fantasy setting and has some very diverse races to play which with the current plans will only increase. The inclusion of magic and flying works well and there are plenty of other improvements which are very enjoyable.  The biggest issue for me is that some existing cultures are spams of themselves eg Marienburg, the empire and talabacland have the same units but I can easily look past this issue.  Overall I'd give this game an 8 out of 10 (basically a great game just not perfect yet).",1,0

222940,THE KING OF FIGHTERS XIII STEAM EDITION,"I really can't recommend this game if you are a KOF fan of old or if you are a new player to fighting games. KOFXIII takes away alot from the classic style of KOF gameplay of footsies and speed in favor of boring, very long and repetitive combo's and the significance of poking and big individual hits is heavily toned down. Many characters movelists are netuered as well, leaving much to be desired.  It's also not a good game to get into if you are new to fighting games, the more complicated commands like Ranbu's and such will turn away newbie's that are only familiar with Street Fighter, and this isn't a game where you can just fireball then dp all jump-in's. It won't work.  The online play is a major mixed bag, and because of that, it's hard to get good matches.   If you really want to play KOF online, I'd suggest getting The King Of Fighters '98 Ultimate Match Final Edition or 2002 Unlimited Match. Much better KOF games than this one.",-1,0

372000,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),"Tree of Savior is no doubt beautifully designed. Attacks, animations are very smoothe and accurate. Movement works fine and skill effects are very well done.

If you need specific items to collect from certain monsters have fun remembering where they are all located. Very kiddy Bosses and much of the gear (Clothing) doesn't change when equipting it.  The game although repetetive can be fun if you party up or play with friends ... for me it was like a 5 or 6/10  I always give MY HONEST OPINION. this is mine.",-1,1

232790,Broken Age,"Update: Now that I have finally beaten the game i can give my final thoughts on it.  And damn this game is cute as hell. It's actually very nice to play a game that is so earnest and designed with no amount of cynicism. It's been while since I played act 1 that I'm glad the second half pays off so well. In fact, I was worried a little bit going into act 2 that I would be confused because it has been so long since playing act 1 but I was surprised how much of the game world and characters, even small personality quirks of minor characters I remembered. I guess that just goes to show how memorable and inventive the world actually is.   Another good surprise is that I enjoyed the difficulty of the puzzles in the second half. I thought the first half was perhaps a little too easy despite still being enjoyable. The puzzles in the second half require more lateral thinking to solve but not so much that they become annoyingly obfuscated. There was probably just one instance (actually the instance where I needed outside help I admit) that I thought was somewhat vague. Though, I am also not always very observant.  If I had one complaint it would be that I would have liked to have seen more areas of this world. You kind of get thrown into only a handful of locations. But, the trade off for that is that these areas are really deeply characterized. The objects and people that inhabit these locations are all memorable. Heck even something as innocuous as the dinning utensils are brimming with personality. Also this narrower focus makes a more tightly woven story where there are many twists and turns. Areas you though you previously thoroughly explored in the first act will be completely changed and take on different meaning in the second half.   Overall, its a very fun and funny adventure time and through my time playing it I usually had just the dumbest grin on my face.  VVV--Thoughts from when I played the first half--VVV  I had an incredible time playing this. It's not the hardest adventure game I played, at least the first episode, but it weaves an interesting narrative with funny, memorable characters. Most importantly, Tim Schafer and the people Double Fine show off how incredible they can be at world building, it's the kind of place you can't get enough of. I can't wait for the second episode.",1,0

That darn Fox and Geese game irritated me greatly though. The man just wouldn't go to the quarter I needed him in. It took some time to get the wins I needed for that puzzle.

282210,Sid Meier's Starships,"I think the reason for this game to get most of its negative reviews, is because most people thought that this game would be like Sid Meier's civilization V or beyond earth but it isn´t. This game is more like a little game you can play when you have a break or when you have some spare time. Its not a big 4x game and most people would know if they paid just a little bit of attention to what the devleopers said before its release, but i do still like the game and its funny so i do reccomend it.",1,0

The tutorials are really great, the aesthetic is fantastic (one thing that turned me off of SFIV), and I can easily see how I need to improve.  The game was surprisingly easy to get into and have fun with, and the net code seems to work really well. Plus, as the person who recommended this to me said, it runs on a toaster. Definitely recommended to anyone with any interest in fighting games.",1,0

291010,The Hat Man: Shadow Ward,"Decent game. Heart pumping. Need patience, sense of hearing and direction.  Read the community guides before starting. Have a set of headphones ready. Pay attention to the sound effects. Keep moving, need not turning back, its all the same maze. Turn around for an alternate way the instant you hear the heart-beatings. Lure the Hat Man to the stair to escape through the other stair or duct. Pay attention and look far for the big hole or a dead end passage, if you see it, turn back quick, it will marks your demise most of times, till you get the bar to pry the wood on wall.  Keep playing without saving till you beat the two achievements, it only makes you more experienced.  Can be frustrating to repeatedly restart the game.  Makes me jump whenever I rotate to see the face of the Hat Man.    Played for the Trading Cards, Achievements and Budget price.  Could give it a try, the price is Right.",1,1

236930,Blackwell Epiphany,"111 reviews, only 15 bucks, published way back in April... how unfortunate.  Only one guide for this game. One. The only one that I could find anyway. I only really looked for it because I had a slight difficulty with something I missed. I'd seen what I needed to do earlier, I just didn't remember, probably because I'd run out of coffee quite a while ago.  Anything I could rag on this game would pretty much be nitpicking. In all honesty, if this game made any screw-ups, they are no worse than certain AAA titles that get stupidly enormous amounts of undeserved praise. The ending wasn't perfect, I kinda saw it coming, but it gripped me and it didn't ♥♥♥♥ me off. Granted, yes, a few holes were left unfilled, but ultimately they can somewhat be ignored due to the way things were wrapped up being quite final. It did seem a tad abrupt, though, but I've seen far worse endings, believe me.  The gameplay tries to draw elements from all the previous titles and succeeds rather well. I felt it was a bit of a challenge without being completely convoluted and irrational as torturing your neighbor's dog for no reason, so I'm happy. At no point did I really need a guide, but nothing was excessively easy. This and the last game both did this pretty well, unlike Convergence which felt rather too straightforward to me.  Maybe the series could have kept going, wrapped a few more loose-ends up, but overall I think this was a fine conclusion to an excellent series. It's a shining light at the end of it all.",1,0

211400,Deadlight,"There such a good premise here that it's easy to try to overlook its failings. The atmosphere is engaging and oozing with style, as the videos and screenshots attest to so clearly. Unfortunately the game itself feels unfinished, and is severely lacking in the kind of polish it would need to be a truly great game. The controls are wonky, there's pretty consistent screen tearing throughout, and you'll regularly get hung up on objects in the enviorment. The writing is some of the worst I have ever seen in a game, and feels like it was composed by someone who learned English as a second (or even third) language. The voice acting is a commesurable degree of terrible, coming off as overwrought and without agency. I was hoping for a mix of Limbo and Shadow Complex, but Deadlight just pales in comparisson to those other games. There's very little exploration or defining moments, just a series of pretty backdrops and hackney gameplay. There's nothing here that apporaches the potential the game clearly possesses, which makes it that much more disappointing. I paid $3 for it, and at that price I guess it's worth a look, but I still can't recommend it at anywhere near full price.",-1,0

234080,Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Ultimate Edition,"It's the year of the Lord 1047, and the Pope just released the encyclical 'About the use of shadow magic, and the embedding of barbed whips into 'crosses and other s..t'': the Holy Communion is down, and going around kicking demon asses is up.  This is the intimate alternate interpretation of the middle ages, where our hero, Gabriel Belmont lives (a view that seems to be perfectly coherent with Japanese's view of Christianity, until you find out that the developer is actually Spanish).  Unibrow, neckbeard and just two facial expressions, he is a broken man, devoid of mercy, untouched by evolution, on a quest for revenge and hope, to vindicate the death of his wife and, possibly, bring her back to life.  This portentous story, introduced at the start of each chapter by the voice of Patrick Stewart, who plays the role of one of Gabriel's comrades in the 'Order of light' (which is a shorthand for 'Order of the ⇓⇘⇒ + Light punch', I guess) basically consists in a lot of platforming and a decent amount of 'monsters ♥♥♥ kicking' (amen).  During each mission, our hero will find the bodies of some of his fallen companions of the order, who died in this same quest before him, leaving behind scrolls with advices (as if following the advice of a dead man was a good idea…), or occasionally some precious life and magic gems that will help him on his holy quest.  That's for the plot.  As far as the game goes, I admit I liked it: the combat is perhaps not as satisfying as DMC, but can hold its own once you get to master it a bit, and there is some variation in settings.  There are some minor issues with the size of the main character, which is just too small in some panoramic takes, and forced me to squint to find my bearings, but the camera worked well overall, and the settings are beautiful.  The platforming is decent/good, though not being fond of this particular game mechanic, I found deeply annoying how much the game relies on it, often inappropriately, possibly as an homage to the primitive aspect of our protagonist.  Just one example.   You enter in a level that clearly introduces a boss battle, reach the enemy which towers you from afar, and just when you are ready to hit it… Oh, no! f…k. It's a platform boss *again*!  Yep. There are the 'platform bosses', aka the 'bosses you can mount' (keep your expectations low, you dog!), which means that 3 of the most important bosses in the game are actually platform levels in disguise, where you grapple on some giant f…er, search for magic sposts and pound on them, trying not to be dismounted. Deja-vu, anyone?  As for the rest of the game, the campaign is very long and satisfying, although the quality is often uneven, and you get the occasionally boring or frustrating level section (usually platforming…), but what really impressed me the most, is the amount of comedy this game unintentionally provides, for example:  - Gabriel has only two expressions: constipated, and that of a caveman, to whom someone has given a pocket calculator  - The comrades of the order of light are so evenly distributed around the world, they are a damn ecological issue. You can't litterly turn a corner, or enter a cave without finding one of those dead fuc…ers littering the ground  - even though Gabriel can jump 2 meters off the ground, perform 6 spins in the air, and land on some unsuspecting enemies like a cataclysm, large suspended beams are his bane: when he encounters one, he almost falls at every step (even though he could just normally walk on them. They are that large)  - Gabriel is barely human. Seriously. I know that not everyone can be as cool as Dante, but this guy? I cannot honestly identify myself with this guy.  - Patrick Stewart narration is great, but repetitive. After all, what can you say that's new after, like, 30 chapters of button mashing? Here is a list of stuff you'll hear over and over:    * Gabriel's rage knows no limits   * Gabriel barely sleeps   * Gabriel never poops (just kidding on this one…)   * in his fury, Gabriel killed a X. The X was the last of his kind   * the glorous race of Y was thriving until the demons arrived   * the last of X of the glorious race of Y died at the hand of our WWF-enthusiast Gabriel   * did I mentioned how Gabriel's rage is boundless?  That said, I really enjoyed the game: just try hard to avoid the 2 DLCs, which you will probably play anyway, but are crap.  PS: oh, and I almost forgot: there is also an infamous, mood breaking 'the cake is a lie' reference. Seriously, guys???",1,0

335300,DARK SOULS™ II: Scholar of the First Sin,"Dark Souls 2 is a great sequel to one of my favorite games. First of all, I highly recommend that you play the original Dark Souls before playing this one. There is really no reason to play 2 before 1.  So assuming that you have played the first one, 2 improves upon some things but also makes some big mistakes.  Combat is for the most part the same. There are slight changes to rolling when locked on, iFrames, and there is also a new move called shield break. The main difference with combat is the edition of power stancing. Power stancing makes dual-wielding more effective by being able to attack with both weapons (if they have the same attack type) when you have 150% of the required stats. Personally I wasn't a huge fan of this change just because I feel that it made rolling essential even earlier than rolling became essential in Dark Souls 1. Nonetheless, I still had fun dual wielding katanas. I just sort of missed having a shield.  One thing I loved about Dark Souls was the non-linear world. Dark Souls 2 has a beautiful but unconnected world. 2 gives you the ability to teleport to every single bonfire you light from the beginning of the game! In 1 all of the areas connect with shortcuts back to the hub area. I still remember the first time I went down the elevator from the church back to firelink. Dark Souls 2 has none of this, the ability to travel to all bonfires removes the purpose of short cuts back to the hub. Because of this crucial mistake, the world of Dark Souls feels very linear and unconnected. This was my main issue with the game. It's not a deal breaker but it is just a bit of a shame.  Other than that there are a just a few minor changes such as losing health everytime you die. That one isn't much of an issue just because the items to reverse it are plentiful and the ring of binding helps a lot if you know you are going to die a lot. Also I just want to add that the DLC included in SOTFS is phenomenal.  Overall I loved this game and highly recommend it if you enjoyed the first. For the most part it is just more of the same amazing DS gameplay.",1,0

The soundtrack is pretty sweet, too, and I wish I could get it as a DLC (In Lossless format, please).  In short; it's a diamond in the rough. Even at full price ($1.99 at the time of this review), it's worth the coin and I got it on sale. I've paid a lot more for a lot less. Fans of the genre; get this.

209870,Blacklight: Retribution,"back in the day this game was the bomb!!! i played a lot of it, and i even spent my fare share of money on this game. Then one day a new company took over, and all of a sudden i just couldnt play the game any more. not because the gakme was bad, in fact the new developers had imporved gameplay. Why do i not play anymore? because when the new developers took over, i lost all my items i had spent money on. I asked them for the items back, but there was no response. i asked for money back, no response. I then tackled steam, but of course i didnt get a refund. it was at this point that the bad taste in my mouth could never be washed away.  I will say one thing, this game has amazing gameplay, it is fast-paced, fun and engaging, but i would take caution with micro-transactions in this game, as you could potentially lose items like i did. I personally would reccomend this, but the experience i went through just annoyed me so much that i have just cant recommend it, though by all means pick it up if you wanted a good first person shooter with a fair business model and engaging gameplay.",-1,1

However, I still enjoyed the game for what it was. I would love to see a sequel or a longer version of the game.",1,0

33230,Assassin's Creed II,"I bought this game yesterday for £2.49. I tried to play it today, but the screen resolution is completely off - the game's top 1/8th appears at the bottom of the screen. It does not detect keyboard input so I cannot blindly change the resolution. It's only £2.49, however I cannot help but be dismayed that this game STILL has bugs that make it unplayable. I probably will find a solution to this soon... But come on... Why should I have to do this?",-1,0
